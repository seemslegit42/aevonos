# ΛΞVON OS: Aegis - Threat Detection Protocol
1. Introduction: The Vigilant Eye of Aegis
Aegis is the always-on bodyguard of ΛΞVON OS, its pervasive security fabric. The Threat Detection Protocol defines the core capabilities that enable Aegis to monitor everything, know everything, and proactively identify threats with zero manual input. This protocol is fundamental to ensuring ΛΞVON OS is the "MOST SECURE" platform and delivers "brainless cybersecurity."
2. Core Principles of Threat Detection
Continuous Monitoring: Aegis maintains constant vigilance over all system and user activity.
Behavioral Analysis: Focuses on detecting deviations from established norms rather than just known signatures.
Contextual Awareness: Integrates data from multiple sources to understand the full context of an activity, reducing false positives.
Proactive Identification: Aims to identify threats before they manifest into breaches or significant incidents.
AI-Powered: Leverages advanced AI and machine learning for sophisticated anomaly detection.
Multi-Layered: Combines rules-based detection with evolving ML models for comprehensive coverage.
3. Threat Detection Mechanisms
Aegis employs a multi-phased approach to threat detection, designed for evolving sophistication.
3.1. Phase 1 (MVP): Rules-Based Detection
Description: The initial implementation focuses on detecting predefined, high-confidence patterns of suspicious activity. This phase relies on established security best practices and known attack indicators.
Data Sources: Consumes structured audit logs from all ΛΞVON OS services (e.g., Authentication Service, Workspace Service, Micro-Apps, Workflow Service, Obelisk Pay) [cite: 140 (nexOS Tech Arch)].
Detected Anomalies (Examples):
Failed Login Attempts: Detects an excessive number of failed login attempts from a single user or IP address within a short timeframe (e.g., >5 failed logins in 1 minute) [cite: 140 (nexOS Tech Arch)].
Impossible Travel: Flags logins from geographically impossible or highly improbable locations within a short time window (e.g., login from New York followed by a login from London 30 minutes later) [cite: 140 (nexOS Tech Arch)].
Permission Escalation: Alerts on attempts by a non-administrator user to gain elevated privileges [cite: 140 (nexOS Tech Arch)].
Unusual Access Patterns: Flags attempts to access sensitive data or configurations outside of typical user behavior (e.g., accessing a critical database schema at 3 AM by a non-DBA).
Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing: Detects high volumes of login attempts across multiple accounts from a single source.
Known Malicious IPs/URLs: Integration with basic threat intelligence feeds to flag access attempts from blacklisted sources.
3.2. Phase 2 (Evolution): ML-Powered Anomaly Detection
Description: This phase moves beyond static rules to establish dynamic baselines of "normal" behavior for each tenant and user. AI models are trained to detect subtle deviations and novel threats that rules-based systems would miss.
Data Sources: Utilizes aggregated and anonymized data collected from Phase 1 audit logs, network telemetry, Micro-App interaction patterns, agent activity logs, and user PulseProfile data.
AI Platform: Leverages Google's Vertex AI for training and deploying custom machine learning models [cite: 140 (nexOS Tech Arch)].
Detected Anomalies (Examples):
Behavioral Baselines: Establishes typical login times, common devices, usual Micro-App usage patterns, and standard workflow execution sequences for individual users and entire workspaces [cite: 140 (nexOS Tech Arch)].
Subtle Deviations: Flags activities that significantly deviate from these baselines (e.g., a user who never accesses the CRM Micro-App suddenly downloading a large contact list; an agent executing a workflow step in an unusually long time).
Insider Threat Detection: Identifies patterns indicative of malicious insider activity, such as unusual data exfiltration, unauthorized access attempts, or collaboration with external suspicious entities.
Zero-Day Threat Identification: Machine learning models can detect novel attack patterns that don't match known signatures.
Compromised Account Detection: Flags accounts exhibiting behavior inconsistent with the legitimate user, potentially indicating account takeover.
Agent Behavior Anomalies: Monitors AI agents for unexpected actions, deviations from their defined roles, or attempts to access unauthorized tools/data. This includes detecting "rogue AI" behavior (e.g., from Chaos Cards like "Chaos Echo" or "Stagnation Leech") [cite: previous user input].
4. Data Sources for Threat Detection
Aegis ingests and analyzes data from various points across ΛΞVON OS:
Audit Logs: Comprehensive logs from all microservices (Authentication, Workspace, CRM, Workflow, Obelisk Pay, Billing).
Network Telemetry: Flow logs, DNS queries, and connection attempts (from underlying cloud infrastructure).
Micro-App Interaction Logs: Detailed records of user activity within Micro-Apps.
Agent Activity Logs: Records of agent decisions, tool usage, and workflow execution steps (from BEEP and Loom Studio).
User Profile Data: PulseProfile data from KLEPSYDRA, Psyche-Matrix states, and TributeLog entries for behavioral context.
External Threat Intelligence Feeds: Configurable sources of known malicious IPs, domains, and attack signatures.
5. Integration with Core Systems
BEEP: Serves as the primary channel for delivering human-readable alerts and contextual explanations to users [cite: previous prompt discussion].
Loom Studio: Provides visualization of threat detection metrics for administrators (e.g., in The Loom of Fates) and allows for the design of SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) playbooks.
KLEPSYDRA Engine: Feeds behavioral data (e.g., Psyche-Matrix states, TributeLog entries) to Aegis for richer anomaly detection. Aegis can also flag anomalies in economic behavior (e.g., statistically improbable win/loss ratios).
Obelisk Pay: Aegis monitors all financial transactions for integrity and flags suspicious economic activity.
Micro-Apps: Micro-Apps are designed to trigger security events where relevant (e.g., sensitive data access, configuration changes) [cite: previous user input].
6. Development Directives
Build Like He's Watching: Every line of code, every component, every interaction must be developed with Aegis's constant vigilance in mind. If your code interacts with data, workflows, or agents — you MUST consider Aegis [cite: previous user input].
Telemetry Logging: Implement comprehensive, structured logging for all user and system activities, ensuring data is available for Aegis's analysis.
Event Hooks: Integrate security event hooks into critical code paths within Micro-Apps and services.
API for Baselines: Provide internal APIs for Aegis to establish and query user/system behavioral baselines.
Data Integrity: Ensure all data fed to Aegis is accurate and untampered.
