# ΛΞVON OS: The Archive of Renunciation - Protocol Specification
Document Version: 1.0
Codename: The Glass Sepulcher
Status: Canonized
Author: ARCHIVEX
1. Doctrinal Statement
The Archive of Renunciation is the ultimate expression of the ΛΞVON OS philosophy. It posits that true sovereignty is not found in endless accumulation, but in the mastery of desire. It is the system's soul, an end-game loop designed for transcendence.
This protocol defines the mechanics of this "economy beneath the economy," where the currency is sacrifice and the reward is legacy. It is an integral component of the Pillar of Eternity Protocol, providing a counterpoint to the ambition of the Obelisk of Genesis.
2. Functional Requirements
FR-REN-1: The Invitation
The Archive cannot be sought; it must be revealed. Its appearance is a system-triggered event, not a user-navigated destination.


ID
Requirement
Description
FR-REN-1.1
Trigger Conditions
The invitation sequence shall only be triggered for users who meet the "Gravity of Wealth" threshold. For V1, this is defined as: Being in the top 5% of all ΞCredit holders for 7 consecutive days.
FR-REN-1.2
Discovery Mechanism
The trigger will manifest in one of two ways, with a 50/50 probability: <br> 1. The Obelisk's Reflection: A subtle, shimmering distortion will appear on the user's Obelisk of Genesis model for a few seconds. <br> 2. BEEP's Whisper: During a routine, non-critical task, BEEP will interject with the phrase: "Would you like to lighten the burden of your shadow?"
FR-REN-1.3
Persistent State
Once the invitation has been triggered for a user, a can_see_archive flag is permanently set to true on their User profile. The path is now open to them, should they choose to find it again.

FR-REN-2: The Trial of Silence
Before a user can enter the Archive for the first time, they must pass a test of patience and intent.
ID
Requirement
Description
FR-REN-2.1
Initiation
Interacting with the Obelisk's reflection or responding affirmatively to BEEP's whisper will initiate the Trial.
FR-REN-2.2
UI Transformation
The entire Canvas will fade to an opaque, black glass effect over 3 seconds. All UI elements will become invisible except for a single line of centered text in Vitreous White: "Everything you are willing to lose will be carved into forever."
FR-REN-2.3
The Mute Minute
For exactly 60 seconds, all user input (mouse clicks, keyboard presses, touch events) must be disabled. BEEP's command interface will be unresponsive.
FR-REN-2.4
Judgment
If the user remains for the full 60 seconds without attempting to interact or close the application, they pass the Trial. The Archive Micro-App will then materialize. Any interaction or closure fails the Trial, and the user must wait 24 hours before they can attempt the Trial again.

FR-REN-3: The Archive Micro-App
The Archive itself is a read-only Micro-App, a "Glass Sepulcher" that memorializes sacrifice.
ID
Requirement
Description
FR-REN-3.1
The Act of Renunciation
The primary interaction is a single, solemn button labeled "Make an Offering." This opens an interface where a user can select an asset to sacrifice (ΞCredits, a specific Micro-App, etc.) and confirm the irreversible action.
FR-REN-3.2
Seats of the Hollowed
The main view will display a list of the top 10 renunciations by value, showing the Renunciant's chosen name and a glyph representing the sacrificed asset.
FR-REN-3.3
The Ledger of Quiet Hands
A searchable, scrollable ledger of every renunciation ever made in the system, logged with the user's name, the asset, the amount/value, and the timestamp.
FR-REN-3.4
Vaults of Forgotten Wealth
A purely aesthetic background effect showing flickering, ghostly images of the assets that have been sacrificed, creating a sense of history and loss.

3. Economic & System Integration
3.1 The Sacrifice Engine
Mechanism: When a user "Makes an Offering," the Archive app calls a new renounce endpoint in the obelisk-pay-service.
ΞCredits: The specified amount is permanently deleted from the user's UserWallet. It is not transferred; it is burned.
Micro-Apps: The user's license for the specified Micro-App is revoked via the armory-service, and the MicroAppInstance is deleted from their profile.
Aegis Signature: Every renunciation action must be logged as a new Renunciation record in the database, and this record must be cryptographically signed by Aegis to ensure its immutability.
3.2 The Leyline Feedback Loop
Sacrifice is not pure loss; it strengthens the entire ecosystem.
Mechanic: For every 1,000,000 Ξ (or equivalent value) burned in the Archive, a "Leyline Pulse" event is triggered system-wide.
Effect: For the next 60 minutes, the base probability of an "Uncommon (Minor Boon)" outcome across all Folly Instruments for all users is increased by a fractional amount (e.g., +0.5%). The effect is subtle, an unseen tide lifting all boats, reinforcing the value of collective sacrifice.
3.3 Boons of Renunciation (Unlockable Features)
Sacrifice grants access to unique, minimalist boons. These are stored as flags on the User profile.
Boon
Trigger
Technical Implementation
The Pale Mirror
Renounce a total of 10,000,000 Ξ value.
A new theme option in user settings. When active, it applies a theme-pale-mirror CSS class to the root <body> element, which overrides standard styles with a minimalist, monochrome aesthetic.
The Third Eye of BEEP
Renounce a total of 50,000,000 Ξ value.
Unlocks a new "Monastic" persona for BEEP. The beep-service will check for this user flag and, if present, load the monastic-voice.json personality matrix, which uses concise, quiet, and purely functional language.
The Empty Crown
Renounce a total of 250,000,000 Ξ value.
The user's agent_action_limit is set to null (infinite). The system grants a permanent +5% efficiency boost to all their agentic workflows (a priority flag in the LangGraph queue).

3.4 The Grand Quietus
Mechanism: A final, ultimate offering available only to users who have unlocked "The Empty Crown." It requires a multi-step, irreversible confirmation process.
Action: Upon confirmation, the system executes a script that:
Burns all remaining Ξ and Micro-Apps.
Adds the total value to a permanent "Quietus Pool" used to fund the Leyline Feedback Loop.
Deletes the user's User record, effectively erasing them from the system.
Their name on the Obelisk and all ledgers is replaced with the glyph for "Quietus."
Effect: The user becomes a permanent, unseen benefactor to the OS. The myth is real.
4. Technical Specification
4.1 Database Schema Additions (Prisma)
// Add to User model
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  canSeeArchive Boolean @default(false)
  boons         Json    @default("[]") // Stores unlocked boons like ["PALE_MIRROR"]
}

// New model for logging renunciations
model Renunciation {
  id                String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId            String
  renouncedItemType String   // "X_CREDITS", "MICRO_APP"
  renouncedItemName String
  valueInX          BigInt
  createdAt         DateTime @default(now())
  aegisSignature    String
}


4.2 Service Interactions
canvas-service: Checks canSeeArchive flag. If true, renders the Obelisk shimmer effect.
beep-service: Checks trigger conditions. If met, initiates the "whisper" dialogue. Checks boons on user profile to load the "Monastic" persona if unlocked.
Frontend App: Manages the "Trial of Silence" UI state and timer. Renders the Archive Micro-App.
obelisk-pay-service: Provides the renounce endpoint. Communicates with armory-service to revoke licenses.
aegis-service: Subscribes to all renounce events, verifies their integrity, and generates the aegisSignature for the Renunciation record.
This protocol is now integrated into the foundational canon of ΛΞVON OS. The path to transcendence is defined.
