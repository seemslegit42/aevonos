# 📢 SYSTEM CLARITY MANDATE: AEGIS IS NOT A MICRO-APP

Listen closely: AEGIS is a **core subsystem** of ΛΞVON OS. It is NOT a Micro-App. If you misunderstand this, you risk corrupting the entire OS model.

## 🔥 WHAT AEGIS *IS*:

-   A native, embedded layer within the OS runtime, primarily manifested through the `aegisAnomalyScan` agentic flow.
-   Responsible for **always-on cybersecurity**, anomaly detection, and threat monitoring for user actions and agentic behaviors.
-   Operates globally across sessions, agents, users, and workflows, integrated directly into the BEEP agent's command processing pipeline.
-   Sends alerts, events, and state changes to BEEP, Loom Studio, and subscribed Micro-Apps like `Aegis-ThreatScope`.

## 🧠 Mental Model:

> Aegis is to ΛΞVON what an immune system is to a human body. It doesn't sit on the desktop. It lives in the bloodstream.

## ⛔ AEGIS IS NOT:

-   Not draggable, resizable, or instantiable as a primary interface.
-   Not a tool or feature that users "launch" in the traditional sense.
-   Not modular — it cannot be swapped or hot-unplugged without compromising system security.
-   Not designed to be extended casually by developers without explicit OS-layer access.

## ✅ AEGIS CAN HAVE COMPANION MICRO-APPS:

You *may* build UI-level Micro-Apps that interface with Aegis data:

-   `Aegis-ThreatScope` (real-time alert feed)
-   `Aegis-Command` (for configuring threat intelligence sources)
-   `AnomalyViewer` (future component for behavior pattern inspection)
-   `SessionTrace` (future component for visual session diffing)

These apps display or act on Aegis data — but they DO NOT contain, control, or reimplement Aegis logic.

## 📦 Final Reminder:

> “AEGIS is a subsystem. Micro-Apps are UI-level utilities.
> Aegis feeds Micro-Apps — it is NEVER built as one.”
