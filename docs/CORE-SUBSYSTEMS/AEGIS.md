# 📢 SYSTEM CLARITY MANDATE: AEGIS IS NOT A MICRO-APP
Listen closely: AEGIS is a **core subsystem** of ΛΞVON OS. It is NOT a Micro-App. If you misunderstand this, you risk corrupting the entire OS model.
## 🔥 WHAT AEGIS *IS*:
- A native, embedded layer within the OS runtime
- Responsible for **always-on cybersecurity**, anomaly detection, and threat monitoring
- Operates globally across sessions, agents, users, and workflows
- Sends alerts, events, and state changes to BEEP, Loom Studio, and subscribed Micro-Apps
## 🧠 Mental Model:
> Aegis is to ΛΞVON what an immune system is to a human body. It doesn't sit on the desktop. It lives in the bloodstream.
## ⛔ AEGIS IS NOT:
- Not draggable, resizable, or instantiable
- Not a tool or feature that users "launch"
- Not modular — it cannot be swapped or hot-unplugged
- Not designed to be extended casually by developers without explicit OS-layer access
## ✅ AEGIS CAN HAVE COMPANION MICRO-APPS:
You *may* build UI-level Micro-Apps that interface with Aegis:
- `ThreatScope` (real-time alert feed)
- `AnomalyViewer` (behavior pattern inspection)
- `SessionTrace` (visual session diffing)

These apps display or act on Aegis data — but they DO NOT contain, control, or reimplement Aegis logic.
## 📦 Final Reminder:
> “AEGIS is a subsystem. Micro-Apps are UI-level utilities.  > Aegis feeds Micro-Apps — it is NEVER built as one.”
