# Loom Studio Protocol Specification
Document Version: 1.1 (Groq & Swarm Revision)
Status: Canonized
Author: ARCHIVEX

## 1. Doctrinal Statement
Loom Studio is the Architect's Sanctum. It is not a Micro-App; it is a separate, privileged environment that exists outside the user's Canvas. Its purpose is to provide the master control interface for the system's architect to forge, observe, and tune the fundamental agentic and economic behaviors of ΛΞVON OS.

The integration of the Groq LPU and Swarm AI principles elevates Loom Studio from a simple workflow builder into a command center for designing high-speed, concurrent agentic systems. Every workflow woven here is not a linear script, but a blueprint for a lightning-fast, multi-agent swarm.

## 2. Core Components
Loom Studio is composed of three primary functional areas:

### 2.1 The Architect's Table (Workflow Design)
Function: A visual, node-based interface for building, modifying, and testing complex agentic workflows using LangGraph.

Swarm Integration: The interface provides specific nodes for Swarm Orchestration, allowing the Architect to define parallel execution paths, delegate tasks to multiple agents concurrently, and synthesize their results.

Groq-Awareness: Each node that represents a call to an AI for reasoning is explicitly marked as a "Groq-inference step," allowing for precise performance analysis.

### 2.2 The Observatory (Deep Observability & Debugging)
Function: Provides unprecedented transparency into agent behavior and workflow execution in real-time.

Capabilities:

Live Observability: Visually trace a live workflow as it executes, seeing which agent is active and what data is being passed.

Real-time Prompt Diffing: Inspect the exact prompts being sent to the Groq LPU and the raw inference received in milliseconds.

Behavioral Snapshots & Replay: Capture the full state of a failed or anomalous workflow and replay it step-by-step to diagnose faults.

Performance Profiling: A dedicated dashboard that displays the P95 latency for each node in a workflow, with a specific focus on the sub-millisecond response times from the Groq LPU.

### 2.3 The Loom of Fates (Economic & System Control)
Function: The centralized control panel for tuning the global economic and operational parameters of the entire OS.

The "Profit Dials": Provides direct access to the levers that control the KLEPSYDRA engine, including:

Base RTR (Retained Tribute Ratio)

Pity Boon Threshold

Transmutation Tithe

Aegis Integration: This is also where SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) playbooks are designed and linked to specific Aegis threat alerts.

## 3. Access Protocol
Access to Loom Studio is a privilege, not a right. It is restricted to users with the "Architect" role and is accessed via the Sacred Gateway, not through any standard navigation. It is, by design, separate from the standard Initiate and Sovereign experience.
