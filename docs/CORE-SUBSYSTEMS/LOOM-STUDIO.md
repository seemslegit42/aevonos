# 🧠 SYSTEM CLARITY MANDATE: LOOM STUDIO IS NOT A MICRO-APP

LOOM STUDIO is a **native, privileged orchestration layer** inside ΛΞVON OS. It is NOT a Micro-App. Do not mistake the UI for its role.

## 🎛️ WHAT LOOM STUDIO *IS*:
- A visual environment for **orchestrating agents, workflows, and prompt chains**
- The default interface for inspecting and manipulating agentic logic
- Provides runtime debugging, observability, and configuration for LangGraph graphs
- Lives in the persistent Canvas layer — not sandboxed like Micro-Apps

### 🧠 Mental Model:
> Loom is the architect’s table — not the tool drawer.
> It is where the automation *blueprints* are assembled, tuned, and connected.

## ⚠️ LOOM STUDIO IS NOT:
- Not draggable, closable, or modular like Micro-Apps
- Not an isolated unit — it sits above the Micro-App layer
- Not extendable without explicit system-level permission
- Not theme-bound; it dictates how agents *behave*, not just how they look

### 🧩 What Loom Can Touch:
- Micro-Apps (by spawning or modifying agent flows within them)
- BEEP (as an agentic interface that integrates into orchestration chains)
- Aegis (via subscriptions to security-driven flow conditions)

### ✅ You *may* build companion Micro-Apps that consume Loom outputs:
- `GraphMetrics` (visualize agent execution time)
- `PromptTester` (run isolated LangGraph nodes with test prompts)

These tools interact with Loom — but they are **not** Loom itself.

## Final Reminder:
> “Loom is a privileged system UI. Micro-Apps are consumer utilities.
> Loom *commands*. Micro-Apps *serve*. Know the difference. Build accordingly.”
