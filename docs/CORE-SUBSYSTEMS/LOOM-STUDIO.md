# 🧠 SYSTEM CLARITY MANDATE: LOOM STUDIO IS NOT A MICRO-APP

LOOM STUDIO is a **native, privileged orchestration layer** inside ΛΞVON OS. It is a visual IDE designed for LLM agent workflows — a conversational-first, visually composable, agent orchestration studio, distinct from traditional IDEs or low-code tools. Do not mistake the UI for its role.

## 🎛️ WHAT LOOM STUDIO *IS*:
- A visual environment for **orchestrating agents, workflows, and prompt chains**.
- The central hub for creating, debugging, and deploying all AI workflows.
- A design that emphasizes a **'roman glass artifact' aesthetic** with minimal UI and conversational actions.
- Integrates fully into the broader OS ecosystem.

### Core Functionalities:
- **Agent Behavior Composition**: Build agent logic using natural language or visual nodes.
- **Event Debugging & Replay**: Step through and analyze workflow executions.
- **Visual Canvas**: A dedicated space for composing and understanding workflow logic.
- **Multimodal Input**: A prompt builder that handles diverse data types.

### 🧠 Mental Model:
> Loom is the architect’s table — not the tool drawer.
> It is where the automation *blueprints* are assembled, tuned, and connected.

## 🔮 Key Potential Features:
- **Behavioral Snapshots**: Capture and restore agent states.
- **Real-Time Prompt Diffing**: Visually compare changes to prompts.
- **Live Observability**: Monitor agent performance and data flow in real-time.
- **Agent DNA Viewer**: Inspect the core logic and configuration of any agent.

## ✅ LOOM CAN:
- Orchestrate Micro-Apps by spawning or modifying agent flows within them.
- Use BEEP as an agentic interface that integrates into orchestration chains.
- Subscribe to Aegis for security-driven flow conditions.

## Final Reminder:
> “Loom is a privileged system UI. Micro-Apps are consumer utilities.
> Loom *commands*. Micro-Apps *serve*. Know the difference. Build accordingly.”
