# 🧠 SYSTEM CLARITY MANDATE: LOOM STUDIO IS NOT A MICRO-APP

LOOM STUDIO is a **native, privileged orchestration layer** inside ΛΞVON OS. It is a visual IDE designed for building, debugging, and deploying agentic workflows. It is a conversational-first, visually composable, agent orchestration studio, distinct from traditional IDEs or low-code tools. Do not mistake the UI for its role.

## 🎛️ WHAT LOOM STUDIO *IS*:

-   A visual environment for **orchestrating agents, tools, and workflows**, implemented as a React application in `src/app/loom`.
-   The central hub for creating, debugging, and deploying all AI workflows, which are stored as JSON definitions in the database.
-   A design that emphasizes a **'roman glass artifact' aesthetic** with minimal UI and direct manipulation of workflow nodes.
-   Integrates fully into the broader OS ecosystem, with its workflows being executable via API calls or direct BEEP commands.

### Core Functionalities:

-   **Agent Behavior Composition**: Build complex agent logic by connecting trigger, tool, and logic nodes on a visual canvas.
-   **Workflow Run History & Debugging**: Monitor and inspect the logs of past workflow executions.
-   **Visual Canvas**: A dedicated, interactive space for composing and understanding workflow logic using a drag-and-drop interface.
-   **Property Inspector**: A contextual panel for configuring the specific parameters of each node in a workflow.

### 🧠 Mental Model:

> Loom is the architect’s table — not the tool drawer.
> It is where the automation *blueprints* are assembled, tuned, and connected.

## ✅ LOOM CAN:

-   Orchestrate Micro-Apps by triggering agent flows that interact with them.
-   Use BEEP as an agentic interface that can be represented as a node in an orchestration chain.
-   Be extended with new nodes that correspond to new agentic tools available to BEEP.

## Final Reminder:

> “Loom is a privileged system UI. Micro-Apps are consumer utilities.
> Loom *commands*. Micro-Apps *serve*. Know the difference. Build accordingly.”
