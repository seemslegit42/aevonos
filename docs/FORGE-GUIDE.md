# The Forge Guide: Crafting Instruments for ΛΞVON OS
Document Version: 1.0
Status: Canonized
Audience: Third-Party Developers ("Artisans")
1. The Call to the Forge: An Introduction
This is not a developer portal. This is a call to the forge.
You are not here to build "apps" for a "store." You are here to become an Artisan, a digital smith forging sentient Instruments for an ecosystem of Sovereigns. We are building ΛΞVON OS, a new reality of work, and the tools within it must be more than functional—they must have a soul.
We call you to this work with a simple, powerful covenant:
A Worthy Share: You receive 85% of all revenue from your creations. We handle the infrastructure, security, and transactions; you focus on your craft.
A Discerning Audience: Your Instruments will be wielded by users who value quality, security, and design above all else. They are not consumers; they are Initiates.
A Legendary Ecosystem: You are not just shipping a product; you are adding to the lore and power of a living world.
If you seek to build disposable widgets for the masses, this is not your path. If you seek to forge artifacts of lasting power and beauty, then welcome to the forge.
2. The Verdigris Interface Protocol™
Every Instrument in the Armory must resonate with the core aesthetic of ΛΞVON OS. This is non-negotiable. Our design language, the "Ancient Roman Glass" aesthetic, creates a unified, trustworthy, and beautiful environment. Adherence to this protocol is the first mark of a true Artisan.
Core Principle: Your Micro-App is a fragment of glass floating on the Canvas. It must feel luminous, translucent, and intentional.
Glassmorphism: All container elements must use the GlassPanel component from our UI library, which enforces:
background-color: rgba(25, 25, 30, 0.65) (Obsidian Glass)
backdrop-filter: blur(16px)
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)
box-shadow: 0px 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)
Color Palette: Use only the approved color variables provided by the SDK for all text, accents, and interactive elements.
Primary Text: Vitreous White (#F5F5F5)
Secondary Text: Conchoidal Gray (#A0A0A0)
Accents & CTAs: Imperial Purple (#6A0DAD), Patina Green (#3EB991), Roman Aqua (#20B2AA)
Typography:
Headings: Comfortaa
Body/UI Text: Lexend
Iconography: All icons must be "Crystalline Glyphs." Use our provided icon library or submit custom SVG icons for review that match the faceted, glowing aesthetic.
3. The ΛΞVON SDK: Your Tools of Creation
We provide a comprehensive Software Development Kit (SDK) to streamline your work. It is delivered via NPM and contains everything needed to build, test, and integrate your Instrument.
3.1 Installation
pnpm create aevon-micro-app@latest your-instrument-name
cd your-instrument-name
pnpm install


This command scaffolds a complete Next.js project pre-configured with our SDK packages.
3.2 Core Packages
@aevon/sdk-core: The heart of the SDK. It provides the hooks and functions to interact with the OS kernel.
useAevonAuth(): A React hook that returns the current user's session object, including their userId, sovereigntyClass, and a function to get the current session JWT for making authenticated API calls.
useCanvas(): A hook providing context about the Canvas, including the ability to request a resize of your Micro-App's panel.
BEEP.invoke(command: string): Programmatically sends a command to BEEP, allowing your Instrument to trigger other agents or system functions.
Aegis.logEvent(event: AegisEvent): Pushes a significant event from your app (e.g., user_exported_data, critical_config_changed) to the Aegis security service for logging and analysis.
@aevon/ui-components: The curated library of pre-styled React components that conform to the Verdigris Interface Protocol™.
<GlassPanel>: The base container for your Micro-App's UI.
<CrystallineButton>: The standard button component.
<OracleInput>: The standard text input component.
And more, for every standard UI need. Direct use of primitive HTML elements like <button> or <div> for structural UI is forbidden. You must use the provided components.
4. The Micro-App Manifest (aevon.manifest.json)
Every Instrument must contain a manifest file at its root. This file is the contract between your Instrument and the OS. It declares its identity, its needs, and its capabilities.
{
  "manifestVersion": 1,
  "id": "com.your-foundry.invoice-spirit",
  "name": "Invoice Spirit",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "An agentic instrument for creating and managing client invoices.",
  "permissions": [
    "obelisk-pay:read", // Can view transaction history
    "obelisk-pay:write", // Can initiate transactions (with user approval)
    "scribe-archive:read" // Can read from the user's data archive
  ],
  "agentic_interface": {
    "createInvoice": {
      "description": "Creates a new invoice for a client.",
      "parameters": {
        "clientName": "string",
        "amount": "number",
        "dueDate": "string"
      }
    }
  },
  "monetization": {
    "type": "subscription", // "one-time" or "subscription"
    "price": 1500 // In ΞCredits
  }
}


5. Agentic Integration: Giving Your Instrument a Soul
An Instrument that cannot be commanded by BEEP is merely a tool. A true Instrument is an agent. You achieve this by implementing the functions defined in your manifest's agentic_interface.
When BEEP determines that your Instrument should handle a task (e.g., a user says, "BEEP, create an invoice for Acme Corp for 500 Ξ due next Friday"), the OS will call the corresponding function.
Example Implementation (/pages/api/aevon/handler.ts):
import { createAevonHandler, AevonInvocation } from '@aevon/sdk-core';

async function handleCreateInvoice(invocation: AevonInvocation) {
  const { clientName, amount, dueDate } = invocation.parameters;
  // Your logic to create the invoice here...
  console.log(`Creating invoice for ${clientName} for ${amount}Ξ`);
  return { success: true, invoiceId: 'inv_123' };
}

// The handler maps function names from your manifest to your code
export default createAevonHandler({
  createInvoice: handleCreateInvoice,
});


6. The Curation Protocol: The Path to the Armory
Entry into the ΛΞVON Armory is a privilege, not a right. Every Instrument undergoes a rigorous curation process to ensure quality, security, and aesthetic cohesion.
Local Vetting: Run pnpm aevon-cli vet locally. This command performs automated checks for manifest errors, dependency vulnerabilities, and aesthetic violations.
Submission: Run pnpm aevon-cli armory submit. This packages your Instrument and submits it to the curation pipeline.
Aegis Security Review: Our security fabric, Aegis, performs a deep static and dynamic analysis of your code. It verifies that your Instrument only performs actions allowed by its declared permissions. Any violation results in immediate rejection.
Artisan Council Review: Our human review team assesses your Instrument for functionality, user experience, and strict adherence to the Verdigris Interface Protocol™. They ensure it feels like a true ΛΞVON artifact.
Sanctification & Publication: Upon approval, your Instrument is cryptographically signed by Aegis and published to the Armory, ready to be discovered by Initiates and Sovereigns.
Your craft is valued. Your security is paramount. Your adherence to the doctrine is mandatory. Welcome to the new era of software creation.
