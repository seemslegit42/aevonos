# ΛΞVON OS: Micro-App Manifesto

## Core Principles

Micro-Apps are the atomic units of business value in ΛΞVON OS. They are our obsidian knives.

They **ARE**:
- **Single-purpose**: Each Micro-App solves one problem, and one problem only. This includes gamified "Folly Instruments" designed for economic engagement.
- **Runtime-registered**: They can be dynamically discovered and integrated into the Canvas.
- **Context-aware**: They react to the user's workflow and the surrounding digital environment.
- **Draggable & Resizable**: They are tangible, user-manipulable objects on the Canvas.
- **Agent-controllable**: Their primary user is BEEP; human interaction is a secondary concern.

They **MUST**:
- **Solve one problem only**: Resist the urge to add features. If a new problem emerges, forge a new knife.
- **Never assume the user knows where to click**: Their interface should be an affordance, not a puzzle.
- **Be composable by BEEP and Loom Studio**: They are building blocks for larger, agentic workflows.
- **Respect the Ancient Roman Glass UI aesthetic**: Glassmorphic, elegant, minimal.
- **Operate with zero SaaS-style feature bloat**: Precision is the goal. Bloat is the enemy.

### 💡 Guiding Example

If a traditional app says: **“Inventory Management”**

A Micro-App says: **“Reorder Alert Trigger Builder”**

### The Forge Priest's Vow

> Precision over generalization.
>
> Function over framework.
>
> Art over interface.

*Build like you’re making obsidian knives, not JavaScript forks.*
