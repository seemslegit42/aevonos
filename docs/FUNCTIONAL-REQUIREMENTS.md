# ΛΞVON OS - Functional Requirements Specification
Document Version: 1.1 (Groq & Swarm Revision)
Date: 2025-07-03
Status: Canonized
Author: ARCHIVEX
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) defines the complete functional behavior of ΛΞVON OS, Version 1.0. It serves as the master blueprint for development, ensuring all components are engineered in precise alignment with the system's foundational doctrine.
1.2 Scope
The scope of this FRS encompasses the entire ΛΞVON OS ecosystem, including its core subsystems, agentic frameworks, economic engines, user interfaces, and security protocols.
1.3 System Overview
ΛΞVON OS is a post-SaaS Digital Operations Platform (DOP/OS) engineered to eliminate digital friction. Its ultimate promise, "the silence of true automation," is a direct function of its core agentic system's ability to process commands and orchestrate complex workflows at near-instantaneous speed. This is not a background feature but the primary functional pillar of the user experience.
1.4 References
This FRS is synthesized from and supersedes all previous design documents. It is to be interpreted through the lens of the Mem-Cache v2.0 (Groq-Integrated).
2. Core System Functional Requirements
FR-SYS-1: The Canvas Layer
(No changes to this section)
FR-SYS-2: BEEP (Behavioral Event & Execution Processor)
ID
Requirement
Description
FR-SYS-2.1
Privileged Conversational Interface
BEEP shall be the primary, always-on interface for system-wide command and control via natural language.
FR-SYS-2.2
Dual Personality Matrix
BEEP shall operate with two distinct, context-dependent personality matrices (System Voice vs. Instrument Voice). [Decree-Locked]
FR-SYS-2.3
Advanced Command Parsing
BEEP must utilize NLU for intent recognition, slot filling, and contextual understanding.
FR-SYS-2.4
[REVISED] Swarm Orchestration
BEEP shall orchestrate tasks by dynamically selecting and delegating to a swarm of individual agents (Micro-Apps, CrewAI constructs). It must manage concurrent agent execution and synthesize their outputs into a coherent response, leveraging LangGraph for workflow definition.
FR-SYS-3: Aegis (Security Fabric)
(No changes to this section)
FR-SYS-4: Loom Studio
(No changes to this section)
3. Agentic Performance Requirements
This section defines performance not as a technical metric, but as a core system function.
ID
Requirement
Description
FR-PERF-1
[NEW] Speed-of-Thought Interaction
The end-to-end latency from a user submitting a command to BEEP to receiving a textual or UI response must be low enough to feel instantaneous and conversational, eliminating cognitive load. This is the primary function underpinning "the silence of true automation."
FR-PERF-2
[NEW] Real-Time Agentic Response
The system's core AI reasoning and command processing must be performed on a high-speed inference engine (Groq LPU) to meet the functional requirement of FR-PERF-1.
FR-PERF-3
[NEW] Fluid UI Manifestation
When a BEEP command results in a new Micro-App or UI element appearing on the Canvas, the manifestation must be fluid and immediate, with no perceptible loading state.
4. Economic System Functional Requirements
(No changes to this section)
5. Non-Functional Requirements
(This section now contains secondary performance metrics. The primary performance function is defined in Section 3.)
ID
Category
Requirement
NFR-1
Security
The system shall be built on a Zero-Trust Architecture.
NFR-2
Reliability
The system shall be deployed with a zero-downtime strategy.
NFR-3
Scalability
The system must be architected to support 1,000 concurrent active users for V1, with a clear path to scaling to 10,000.
