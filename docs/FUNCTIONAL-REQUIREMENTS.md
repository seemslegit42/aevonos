## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) defines the complete functional behavior of ΛΞVON OS, Version 1.0. It serves as the master blueprint for development, ensuring all components, from the core kernel to the user-facing instruments, are engineered in precise alignment with the system's foundational doctrine. This document is the binding contract between the architectural vision and its technical implementation.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this FRS encompasses the entire ΛΞVON OS ecosystem, including its core subsystems, agentic frameworks, economic engines, user interfaces, and security protocols. It details all user-facing and backend functionalities required to deliver the "Agentic Mythware™" experience.

### 1.3 System Overview
ΛΞVON OS is a post-SaaS Digital Operations Platform (DOP/OS) engineered to eliminate digital friction and deliver "the silence of true automation." It functions as an intelligent orchestration layer, replacing fragmented software stacks with a unified, sovereign ecosystem. Its core tenets are agentic control, absolute security, and a gamified economic model designed to foster user devotion.

| FR-SYS-2.2 | Dual Personality Matrix | BEEP shall operate with two distinct, context-dependent personality matrices. [Decree-Locked] |
| FR-SYS-2.2.1 | System Voice Persona | For core OS operations (Loom Studio, Aegis alerts, system commands), BEEP shall use the Architect's Apprentice, Oracle, and Sentinel personas. |
| FR-SYS-2.2.2 | Instrument Voice Persona | Within all Folly Instruments and economic rituals, BEEP shall use the Seducer, Mentor, Priest, and Steward personas. |
| FR-SYS-2.3 | Advanced Command Parsing | BEEP must utilize NLU for intent recognition, slot filling, and contextual understanding based on conversational history and system state. |
| FR-SYS-2.4 | Agentic Swarm Routing | BEEP shall orchestrate tasks by dynamically selecting and delegating to individual agents or agent teams (Micro-Apps, CrewAI constructs) using LangGraph for workflow execution. |

### FR-SYS-3: Aegis (Security Fabric)
The always-on security and integrity layer.

| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FR-SYS-3.1 | Multi-Layered Threat Detection | Aegis shall perform continuous monitoring using both rules-based detection (Phase 1) and ML-powered anomaly detection (Phase 2) to identify security threats. |
| FR-SYS-3.2 | Economic Guardianship | Aegis must monitor all Obelisk Pay transactions, sign all immutable logs, and flag economic anomalies (e.g., statistically improbable win/loss ratios). |
| FR-SYS-3.3 | Psychological Safety Protocol | Aegis shall monitor each user's Psyche-Matrix. If frustration or loss-aversion metrics cross a predefined critical threshold, Aegis will automatically throttle or disable the Judas Algorithm and Aetheric Echoes for that user. A master override shall exist in the Loom of Fates. [Decree-Locked] |

### FR-SYS-4: Loom Studio
The privileged orchestration and development environment.

| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FR-SYS-4.1 | Architect-Only Environment | Access to Loom Studio shall be restricted to users with "Architect" level privileges. It is a separate environment from the user Canvas. |
| FR-SYS-4.2 | Visual Workflow Design | Loom Studio must provide a visual interface for building, testing, and manipulating LangGraph workflows and agent behaviors. |
| FR-SYS-4.3 | The Loom of Fates | Loom Studio shall house the "Loom of Fates," the economic control panel for adjusting global economic dials (e.g., Base RTR, Pity Boon Threshold). |

## 3. Economic System Functional Requirements
### FR-ECON-1: KLEPSYDRA Engine
The core profit and engagement engine.

| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FR-ECON-1.1 | Sine-Rhythm Modulation | The KLEPSYDRA Engine must dynamically modulate outcome probabilities for each user in real-time based on their personal Sine-Rhythm Engine (SRE) state (crest/trough). |
| FR-ECON-1.2 | Psychological Engine | The engine shall implement the Judas Algorithm (to introduce emotionally potent "miscalculations") and Aetheric Echoes (to visualize the currency of regret), subject to the Aegis safety protocol (FR-SYS-3.3). |
