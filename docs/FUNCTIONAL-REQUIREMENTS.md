# ΛΞVON OS - Functional Requirements Specification

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) defines the complete functional behavior of ΛΞVON OS. It serves as the master blueprint for development, ensuring all components are engineered in precise alignment with the system's foundational doctrine.

1.2 System Overview
ΛΞVON OS is a post-SaaS Digital Operations Platform (DOP/OS) engineered to eliminate digital friction. Its ultimate promise, "the silence of true automation," is a direct function of its core agentic system's ability to process commands and orchestrate complex workflows at near-instantaneous speed. Its secondary promise is to provide a "brainless cybersecurity" experience by integrating a sentient, multi-domain security fabric.

2. Core System Functional Requirements
FR-SYS-1: The Canvas Layer
(No changes to this section)

FR-SYS-2: BEEP (Behavioral Event & Execution Processor)
ID

Requirement

Description

FR-SYS-2.1

Privileged Conversational Interface

BEEP shall be the primary, always-on textual and audible interface for system-wide command and control.

FR-SYS-2.2

Dual Personality Matrix

BEEP shall operate with two distinct, context-dependent personality matrices (System Voice vs. Instrument Voice).

FR-SYS-2.3

Swarm Orchestration

BEEP shall orchestrate tasks by dynamically selecting and delegating to a swarm of individual agents (Micro-Apps, internal services). It must manage concurrent agent execution and synthesize their outputs into a coherent response.

FR-SYS-2.4

[NEW] Critical Action Intermediary

For all actions deemed "Financially Significant" or "System Critical", BEEP shall serve as a mandatory conversational intermediary, preventing direct, unverified execution from external links or scripts, as per the Phalanx Protocol.

FR-SYS-3: Aegis (Security Fabric)
ID

Requirement

Description

FR-SYS-3.1

Multi-Domain Threat Detection

Aegis shall perform continuous, multi-layered threat detection across system access, economic activity, ecosystem integrity, and user psychological state.

FR-SYS-3.2

[NEW] Phishing & Social Engineering Defense

Aegis shall provide active defense against phishing by: <br>1. Architecturally eliminating password-based login vectors. <br>2. Performing real-time, Groq-powered intent analysis on user commands containing external data to identify and block malicious instructions. <br>3. Enforcing a multi-factor "Final Vow" (biometric authorization via Mobile Companion) for the most critical actions.

FR-SYS-3.3

[NEW] Economic Integrity Guarantee

Aegis shall cryptographically sign all transaction logs, monitor the KLEPSYDRA engine for economic exploits, and perform velocity/resonance checks on all transmutations to ensure the absolute integrity of the system's economy.

3. Agentic Performance Requirements
This section defines performance not as a technical metric, but as a core system function.

ID

Requirement

Description

FR-PERF-1

Speed-of-Thought Interaction

The end-to-end latency from a user submitting a command to BEEP to receiving a textual and audible response must be low enough to feel instantaneous and conversational. This is the primary function underpinning "the silence of true automation."

FR-PERF-2

Real-Time Agentic Response

The system's core AI reasoning and command processing must be performed on a high-speed inference engine (Groq LPU) to meet the functional requirement of FR-PERF-1.

4. User Identity & Access Requirements
ID

Requirement

Description

FR-ID-1

Passwordless by Decree

The system shall not contain any user-facing password-based authentication mechanisms.

FR-ID-2

The Rite of Invocation

The initial user onboarding process shall be a narrative-driven, multi-step ritual that establishes the user's identity and attunes the OS to their chosen Vow.

FR-ID-3

The Presence Protocol

For returning users, the system shall support an ambient, biometric-based authentication method that awakens the OS in response to the user's verified physical presence, making an explicit "login" step unnecessary.

5. Economic System Functional Requirements
ID

Requirement

Description

FR-ECON-1

The Closed Loop Doctrine

The system shall facilitate the transmutation of in-system wealth (ΞCredits) into real-world value via the Obelisk Marketplace, governed by a fixed Transmutation Tithe.

FR-ECON-2

The Dual End-Game

The system shall provide two distinct end-game progression paths: The Path of Power (accumulation, via the Obelisk of Genesis) and the Path of Legacy (sacrifice, via the Archive of Renunciation).

FR-ECON-3

Psychological Calibration

The system shall employ the Psyche-Calibration Engine (PCE) to subtly guide the user experience, prevent loss-streak abandonment, and foster a mythology of personal luck.
