# File Explorer: The Scriptorium - Technical Specification

> "All records are sacred. Here is your library."

## 1. System Overview

The File Explorer is a **core utility Micro-App** that provides a familiar, graphical interface for navigating and managing files within the user's workspace. It serves as the visual counterpart to the command-line for file operations.

It is designed for intuitive access, clear organization, and seamless integration with other Micro-Apps that produce or consume files (e.g., Dossier exports, P.I. evidence logs).

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `File-Explorer` Micro-App (`micro-apps/file-explorer.tsx`)
The UI is a clean, standard file browser interface.
- **Directory Tree**: A classic tree view for navigating folders.
- **File List**: A main pane displaying the contents of the selected directory, with icons corresponding to file types.
- **Mocked Data**: For the prototype, this app will display a mocked, static directory structure to demonstrate the UI and interaction patterns. In a production environment, this would be connected to a secure, workspace-scoped file storage service (e.g., a dedicated S3 bucket or Google Cloud Storage).

### 2.2. Agentic Integration
- **File Operations**: BEEP can use dedicated tools (e.g., `list_files`, `create_directory`, `delete_file`) to perform file management tasks via natural language commands. Changes made via BEEP would be reactively reflected in the File Explorer UI.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Invocation**: The File Explorer can be launched from the Canvas or summoned by BEEP, often in response to a command like "show me my files" or "open the project-phoenix directory."
- **Architectural Role**: It serves as a fundamental building block of the OS, providing a necessary visual tool for users who prefer graphical interfaces over the command line for file management. It ensures that the OS is accessible to users of all technical comfort levels.
