## 1. System Overview

Howard's Sidekick™ is a **specialized productivity and lifestyle Micro-App** dedicated to electricians and tradespeople. Inspired by a real-life loyal companion named Howard, the app provides daily reminders, a simple note logger, and quick access to essential trade tools.

This app is a tribute, designed to be a reliable, helpful presence on the job site.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `HowardsSidekick` Micro-App (`micro-apps/howards-sidekick.tsx`)
This is a UI-only Micro-App, demonstrating how to build a useful tool without a dedicated backend agent. All logic is contained within the React component.
- **Tabbed Interface**: The UI is organized into three simple tabs:
  - **Reminders**: A static, hard-coded list of daily safety and wellness reminders (e.g., "Tool Inspection," "Hydration Break").
  - **Logger**: A client-side note-taking feature that allows users to jot down thoughts, which are stored in local component state.
  - **Tools**: A simple accordion component containing mock links or descriptions for common electrician tools (e.g., "Voltage Drop Calculator," "NEC Code Quick Reference").
- **Inspirational Quotes**: The footer of the app cycles through a small, hard-coded array of dog-themed inspirational quotes for electricians.

### 2.2. State Management
- **Local State**: All state, including new notes, is managed entirely within the React component using `useState`. This demonstrates a simple, self-contained Micro-App architecture.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Invocation**: The app can be launched from the Canvas or via a BEEP command.
- **Pricing**: As a tribute app with no backend costs, it is listed as `included` in The Armory, available to all users for free.
- **Architectural Pattern**: Demonstrates that not all Micro-Apps require a complex agentic backend. Simple, client-side utilities are a valuable part of the ecosystem.
