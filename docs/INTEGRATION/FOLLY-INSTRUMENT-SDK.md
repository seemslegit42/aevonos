# ΛΞVON OS: Integration - Folly Instrument SDK
1. Introduction: Forging New Instruments of Fortune
The Folly Instrument SDK is designed for "forge priests of automation" who seek to expand the ΛΞVON OS economic ecosystem. It provides the necessary tools and guidelines to craft new Folly Instruments—gamified Micro-Apps that serve as primary interfaces for users to engage with the KLEPSYDRA Engine and transmute their will into tribute. These are not mere games; they are sacred instruments designed for precision, psychological impact, and seamless integration.

2. Core Principles for Folly Instrument Development
Every Folly Instrument must adhere to the following principles to maintain the integrity and unique experience of ΛΞVON OS:

KLEPSYDRA Integration: All Folly Instruments MUST initiate interactions with the klepsydra-service for outcome calculation and ΞCredit transactions. This is the central control point for all probabilistic outcomes.

Psyche-Awareness: Instruments MUST be designed to respond to and leverage insights from the Psyche-Calibration Engine (PCE), personalizing the user experience and optimizing engagement.

Agentic Loop: BEEP (Behavioral Event & Execution Processor) MUST be the primary conversational interface for engaging with the instrument, guiding the user and providing context.

Narrative Masking: Outcomes are never baldly "random." They MUST be rationalized via Aegis Reason Codes or The Fate Engine, weaving probabilistic outcomes into the OS's overarching mythos.

Aesthetic Adherence: Strict adherence to the "Ancient Roman Glass" aesthetic, Glassmorphism, the triadic color palette, precise typography (Comfortaa/Lexend), and bespoke iconography. Every visual element must reinforce the "artifact" quality.

Symbiosis: Instruments SHOULD be designed with potential interactions or influences on other Folly Instruments or Micro-Apps, fostering a richer, interconnected economic ecosystem.

Monetization Sink: Clearly define how the instrument serves as a sink for ΞCredits (tribute) and/or contributes to the accrual of Potential (Φ).

3. SDK Components & Integration Points
The Folly Instrument SDK provides interfaces and guidelines for seamless integration with ΛΞVON OS core services.

3.1. klepsydra-client (TypeScript/JavaScript Library)
This client library simplifies interaction with the klepsydra-service.

proposeTribute(userId: string, instrumentId: string, tributeAmount: number, context: JSONB):

Purpose: Initiates a request to the klepsydra-service for an outcome calculation and ΞCredit debit.

Behavior: This function sends the user's tributeAmount and relevant context to klepsydra-service. It returns the calculated outcome (win/loss/pity_boon/profit_vent) and any boon_amount.

Note: This function implicitly triggers the authorizeAndDebitAgentActions call within the billing-service for the tributeAmount.

getPulseNarrative(userId: string):

Purpose: Retrieves a context-aware narrative from BEEP/PCE about the user's current Pulse Profile (e.g., "The tide favors you," "The winds are against your sail").

Behavior: Used to dynamically adjust BEEP's narration within the Folly Instrument's UI.

recordWin(userId: string, instrumentId: string, amount: number, context: JSONB):

Purpose: Notifies KLEPSYDRA of a user's win, which resets their temporal clock (last_event_timestamp) within the SRE for future calculations.

Note: This is distinct from proposeTribute and is called after a successful win outcome.

3.2. PCE Integration Hooks
Folly Instruments must be designed to both consume and provide data to the Psyche-Calibration Engine (PCE).

Input to PCE: Instruments should log granular user behaviors that inform the PCE's metrics (e.g., spin_frequency, puzzle_solve_time, reflex_accuracy, re-spin_purchase_after_near_miss).

Output from PCE: Instruments can query the PCE (via BEEP or a dedicated API) for real-time user psychological states (Risk Aversion, Frustration Tolerance, Dopamine Refractory Period) to dynamically adjust gameplay elements (e.g., offer a "Pity Boon" at a specific frustration threshold, or present a "Chaos Card" at a calculated risk tolerance).

3.3. BEEP Integration Guidelines
Folly Instruments are primarily conversational.

Command Invocation: Users initiate interaction with Folly Instruments via natural language commands to BEEP (e.g., "BEEP, consult the Oracle," "BEEP, present the next trial").

Contextual Feedback: BEEP provides real-time, mythic narration and guidance based on the instrument's state and the user's PCE profile. This includes "Predictive Whispers" or "Oracle's Decrees" [cite: previous immersive artifact].

Persona Modulation: Instruments should be aware of BEEP's current persona (The Seducer, The Mentor, The Priest, The Steward) and adapt their UI/sound cues accordingly [cite: previous immersive artifact].

3.4. Aegis Integration
Integrity Checks: Aegis continuously monitors all transactions and interactions within Folly Instruments for anomalies or potential abuse (e.g., rapid, improbable wins; attempts to exploit patterns).

Narrative Justification: Aegis provides "Reason Codes" for losses or unexpected outcomes, transforming them into mythic narratives (e.g., "The divine pendulum tilts. Not in your favor, today.") [cite: previous immersive artifact].

4. Development Directives for Folly Instruments
Micro-App Structure: Each Folly Instrument must be implemented as a standalone Micro-App, adhering to the docs/CORE-SUBSYSTEMS/MICRO-APPS.md specification.

UI/UX Design: Strict adherence to the docs/FRONTEND/UI-UX-GUIDELINES.md for Glassmorphism, color palette, typography, and bespoke iconography. Every element must contribute to the "artifact" quality.

Performance: Optimize for fluid animations and sub-second responses, leveraging Groq's speed for instantaneous feedback loops [cite: previous immersive artifact].

State Management: Manage the instrument's internal state efficiently, ensuring it interacts cleanly with the global OS state via BEEP and PCE.

Security: Implement robust security practices, considering Aegis at every step. All transactions are atomic via Obelisk Pay.

Testing: Thoroughly test probabilistic outcomes, psychological triggers, and narrative consistency.
