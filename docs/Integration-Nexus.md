# Integration Nexus: The Conductor of Worlds - Technical Specification

> "To command your empire, you must have envoys in every court."

---

## 1. System Overview

The Integration Nexus is a **core utility Micro-App** that serves as the central hub for managing connections to third-party services. It allows workspace administrators to securely add, configure, and monitor integrations like Slack, Google Workspace, and Stripe.

This is the bridge between the sovereign territory of ΛΞVON OS and the outside digital world, enabling agents to read and write data across different platforms.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `integration-nexus.tsx` Component
- **Configured Integrations View**: Displays a list of all integrations currently configured for the workspace. Each card shows the integration's name, status (active/inactive), and provides options to manage or delete it.
- **Add Integration Flow**: A dialog-based flow that allows admins to add a new integration.
  1.  The user selects from a list of available `IntegrationManifests` (defined in `config/integration-manifests.ts`).
  2.  Based on the manifest's `authMethod`, the UI prompts for either an API key or initiates an OAuth2 flow.
  3.  The user provides a friendly name for the connection (e.g., "Primary Stripe Account").
  4.  On submit, the configuration is saved to the database.

### 2.2. Backend APIs
The Nexus is powered by a set of secure API endpoints:
- `GET /api/integrations`: Lists all configured integrations for the workspace.
- `POST /api/integrations`: Creates a new integration instance.
- `PUT /api/integrations/{id}`: Updates an existing integration (e.g., changes its status).
- `DELETE /api/integrations/{id}`: Removes an integration and revokes its credentials.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Agent Tooling**: The configurations stored by the Nexus (e.g., API keys) are used by agentic tools (like `slack-tools.ts`) to make authenticated calls to external services.
- **Permissions**: Access to the Integration Nexus is restricted to `ADMIN` and `MANAGER` roles to prevent unauthorized changes to external connections.
- **Architectural Role**: It serves as the OS's diplomatic corps, establishing the secure connections necessary for agents to extend their influence beyond the boundaries of the workspace and automate cross-platform workflows.
