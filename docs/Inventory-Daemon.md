# Inventory Daemon: Supply Chain Intelligence - Technical Specification

> "The chain is only as strong as its most transparent link."

---

## 1. System Overview

The Inventory Daemon is a **specialized, autonomous agent** within the ΛΞVON OS ecosystem. It is the first true implementation of the "Groq Swarm" architecture, designed to provide high-speed, collaborative intelligence on all matters of supply chain and inventory management.

It is not a user-facing Micro-App but a background process that serves as a dedicated subject-matter expert, providing its analysis and services to the central BEEP agent.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `inventory-daemon` Agent (`agents/inventory-daemon.ts`)
The daemon's core logic is encapsulated in a `LangGraph` state machine, allowing it to perform multi-step reasoning.
- **Purpose**: To handle all inventory-related queries and actions with precision and speed.
- **Architecture**: As a LangGraph agent, it can call its own internal tools (`getStockLevels`, `placePurchaseOrder`) in sequence or in parallel, reason about the results, and formulate a comprehensive final answer. This makes it more powerful than a simple tool-calling flow.

### 2.2. Agentic Tools (`ai/tools/inventory-tools.ts`)
The daemon is equipped with its own specialized tools for interacting with a (currently mocked) inventory system.
- **`getStockLevels`**: Retrieves the current stock quantity and status for a given product ID.
- **`placePurchaseOrder`**: Initiates a new purchase order for a specified product and quantity from a designated supplier.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **BEEP Orchestration**: The primary way to interact with the Inventory Daemon is through the central BEEP agent. When a user asks a question like, "How many widgets are in stock?" or "Order 500 widgets from Supplier X," BEEP recognizes the inventory-related intent and delegates the entire query to the Inventory Daemon.
- **The Groq Swarm**: The Inventory Daemon is the first example of a specialist agent in the swarm. Its existence allows BEEP to offload complex, domain-specific reasoning, making the central kernel faster and more efficient. BEEP synthesizes the final report from the Daemon into a user-facing response.
- **Billing**: All tool calls made by the Inventory Daemon (`getStockLevels`, `placePurchaseOrder`) are billable Agent Actions, debited by Obelisk Pay. This ensures that even complex, multi-step background processes are accurately metered and monetized.
