# ΛΞVON OS: Data Governance & Privacy Protocol
Document Version: 1.0
Status: Canonized
Author: ARCHIVEX
Jurisdiction: Canada (Federal - PIPEDA)
1. The Doctrine of Sacred Trust
This is not a privacy policy. It is a covenant.
In the ecosystem of ΛΞVON OS, data is the lifeblood of our users' digital sovereignty. We handle not just operational metrics, but the very essence of their strategic and psychological states—their Psyche-Matrix. The trust required to operate such a system is absolute and non-negotiable.
This Protocol defines our unyielding commitment to protecting this sacred trust. We do not view privacy as a legal obligation to be met, but as a core design principle and a moral imperative. Every byte of data is handled with the respect it deserves, secured by our vigilant guardian, Aegis, and governed by the principles of transparency, limitation, and user sovereignty.
Our promise is simple: Your data serves your experience, and its protection is our highest duty.
2. Core Principles of Data Governance
Sovereignty & Consent: You, the user, are the sovereign of your data. We will not collect, use, or disclose your personal information without your knowledgeable and explicit consent. This consent is obtained during "The Rite of Invocation" and can be managed at any time.
Purpose Limitation: We will identify the purposes for which we collect data before or at the time of collection. We only collect what is necessary to deliver, secure, and enhance the functionality of ΛΞVON OS. We do not engage in indiscriminate data harvesting.
Radical Transparency: You have the right to know what information we hold about you and how it is used. We will provide clear, accessible information about our data practices.
Security by Design: Data protection is not an add-on; it is woven into the fabric of our architecture. From database encryption to access control, every layer of the system is designed to protect your information.
Accountability: We are accountable for the data in our charge. We have appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who is responsible for ensuring compliance with this protocol and all applicable laws.
3. Data Classification
All data within ΛΞVON OS is classified to ensure appropriate levels of protection.
Class
Name
Description & Examples
Required Safeguards
I
Public
Information intended for public display.
Standard access controls.




Syndicate names on the Obelisk, Armory marketplace listings.


II
Operational
Anonymized or aggregated data used for system health and analytics.
Anonymization, access restricted to internal engineering teams.




Micro-App usage telemetry, performance metrics.


III
Confidential
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) required for account operation.
AES-256 encryption at rest, strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).




User email address, billing information for transmutations.


IV
Sacred
Highly sensitive data that forms the core of the user's psychological and economic profile.
End-to-end encryption, application-level field encryption, access strictly limited to automated systems (Aegis, KLEPSYDRA) and audited emergency protocols. Direct human access is forbidden.




Raw Psyche-Matrix data, detailed transaction logs, SRE wave state.



4. Data Handling Protocols
4.1 Collection & Consent
Personal information will only be collected with explicit user consent, obtained during the onboarding ritual. The purpose for each piece of data (e.g., "Your email is used for account recovery and critical security alerts") will be clearly stated.
Collection of Sacred data requires a separate, explicit opt-in, explaining that it is used to power the personalized economic and psychological engines of the OS.
4.2 Storage & Encryption
All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3.
All data is encrypted at rest within our PostgreSQL database using AES-256.
All Class IV (Sacred) data fields within the database will be subject to an additional layer of application-level encryption, meaning the data is unreadable even with direct database access. The decryption keys are held in a separate, highly secure key management service (e.g., GCP KMS).
4.3 Access Control
A strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policy is enforced across all systems.
Engineers and support staff do not have standing access to production databases. Emergency access is temporary, requires multi-factor approval, and is logged immutably by Aegis.
Direct human access to raw Class IV data is architecturally and policy-wise prohibited. This data is processed only by our automated systems.
4.4 Retention & The Rite of Forgetting
We will retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill its stated purpose or as required by law.
Users have the right to request the deletion of their account and all associated personal information. This process, "The Rite of Forgetting," will be made available through the user's account settings and will permanently erase all PII from our systems within 30 days, subject to legal requirements for retaining certain transaction data.
5. Compliance with Canadian Law (PIPEDA)
ΛΞVON OS is designed and operated in full compliance with Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). We uphold its 10 fair information principles:
Accountability: Our designated DPO is responsible for our compliance.
Identifying Purposes: We state the purpose of data collection at or before the time of collection.
Consent: We obtain meaningful consent for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.
Limiting Collection: We limit collection to what is necessary for the identified purposes.
Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention: We do not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with consent or as required by law.
Accuracy: We keep personal information as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is necessary.
Safeguards: We protect personal information with security safeguards appropriate to its sensitivity.
Openness: We make our privacy policies and practices readily available to our users.
Individual Access: Users have the right to access their personal information and challenge its accuracy.
Challenging Compliance: Users have the right to challenge our compliance with these principles.
6. Data Breach Incident Response Protocol
In the event of a data breach, we will execute the following protocol, which will be detailed further in the Security Operations & Incident Response Plan:
Immediate Containment: Aegis will detect and attempt to automatically contain the breach, isolating affected systems and revoking credentials.
Assessment: The DPO and Security Team will immediately assess the scope and scale of the breach.
Notification: If the breach is determined to create a "real risk of significant harm" to individuals, we will notify the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) and all affected individuals as soon as feasible.
Remediation: We will take all necessary steps to remediate the vulnerability and restore the integrity of our systems.
This protocol is our pledge. It is the foundation of the trust you place in ΛΞVON OS.
