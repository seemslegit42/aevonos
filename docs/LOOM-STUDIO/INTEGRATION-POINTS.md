# ΛΞVON OS: Loom Studio - Integration Points
1. Introduction: The Nexus of Intelligence
Loom Studio is not an isolated application; it is the nexus of intelligence within ΛΞVON OS, deeply integrated with all major subsystems. It serves as the visual command center where the "blueprints" of automation are forged, debugged, and connected to the living pulse of the OS. This document details the critical integration points that enable Loom Studio's comprehensive functionality.
2. Core Integration Principles
Seamless Communication: Facilitate fluid data exchange and command invocation between Loom Studio and other services.
Contextual Awareness: Leverage system-wide context to provide relevant insights and actions within the Studio.
Security by Design: All integrations adhere to Aegis protocols, ensuring secure data flow and agent governance.
Performance: Optimize integration points for low-latency communication, supporting real-time debugging and orchestration.
Modularity: Maintain clear API contracts for each integration, allowing for independent development and updates of connected services.
3. Integration with Core ΛΞVON OS Subsystems
3.1. BEEP (Behavioral Event & Execution Processor)
Purpose: BEEP is the primary conversational interface for interacting with Loom Studio, enabling natural language control over workflow design and agent orchestration.
Integration Points:
Workflow Scaffolding: BEEP sends natural language requests (e.g., "create a workflow for new employee onboarding...") to Loom Studio's backend service. Loom Studio then generates a draft workflow (LangGraph JSONB) on the visual Canvas, ready for user refinement.
Contextual Guidance: BEEP provides real-time, personalized suggestions within Loom Studio based on the user's current workflow design, selected nodes, or Psyche-Matrix profile.
Agent Persona Modulation: Loom Studio provides the context (active Micro-App, workflow stage) that influences BEEP's persona (Trinity of BEEP) for specific interactions.
Command Invocation: Users can issue natural language commands to BEEP from within Loom Studio (e.g., "BEEP, run this workflow," "BEEP, debug this agent's memory").
3.2. Aegis (Cybersecurity Fabric)
Purpose: Aegis ensures the security, integrity, and compliance of all agentic workflows and data managed by Loom Studio.
Integration Points:
SOAR Playbook Design: Loom Studio provides the visual interface for designing Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) playbooks. These workflows are triggered by security incidents detected by Aegis.
Agent Governance Enforcement: Aegis monitors agent behavior within Loom Studio-orchestrated workflows, flagging anomalies and enforcing sandboxing/capability limits. Loom Studio visualizes these governance alerts.
Data Integrity Protocol: Loom Studio's data (workflow definitions, execution logs, debugging telemetry) is protected by Aegis's Data Integrity Protocol, ensuring immutability and auditability.
Prompt Injection Sandbox: Aegis protocols are integrated into the sandbox to ensure safe testing of prompts against security vulnerabilities.
3.3. Micro-Apps
Purpose: Micro-Apps serve as callable "tools" or "nodes" within LangGraph workflows designed in Loom Studio, extending the capabilities of agents.
Integration Points:
Micro-App Node in Palette: The Workflow Designer's Palette includes a "Micro-App Node" allowing users to select from installed Micro-Apps and configure their inputs/outputs within a workflow.
Agent Tool Invocation: LangGraph workflows executed by Loom Studio dynamically invoke Micro-App functionalities via their internal APIs as part of agent problem-solving.
Contextual Data Exchange: Micro-Apps can provide context-aware data to Loom Studio for use in workflow logic or debugging.
3.4. KLEPSYDRA Engine (Profit Pulse Engine)
Purpose: Loom Studio provides the operational interface for managing and visualizing the ΛΞVON OS economy, driven by the KLEPSYDRA Engine.
Integration Points:
The Loom of Fates: A dedicated dashboard within Loom Studio for internal ops and elite devs. It visualizes the system-wide economic pulse (animated sinewave), Φ accumulation heatmaps by cohort, and real-time alerts for economic anomalies or churn risk.
Profit Dials: Loom Studio exposes "Profit Dials" to authorized administrators, allowing them to tune the economic engine's parameters (e.g., PityThreshold, CrashGuard, SensitivityModifier).
Folly Instrument Design: Loom Studio facilitates the design and integration of new Folly Instruments, defining their probabilistic outcomes and linking them to KLEPSYDRA's calculate_outcome() function.
TributeLog Visualization: Allows detailed drill-down into TributeLog entries for economic auditing and analysis.
3.5. Data Layer (PostgreSQL, Redis, Supabase Storage)
Purpose: Provides persistence for workflow definitions, execution history, agent states, and debugging telemetry.
Integration Points:
PostgreSQL: LoomStudioService uses Prisma ORM to store workflow_definitions (LangGraph JSONB), workflow_runs, and detailed debugging logs.
Redis: Used for caching frequently accessed data and managing the transient state of active agent sessions and workflow runs.
Supabase Storage: For storing larger unstructured data files associated with workflows (e.g., documents processed by agents).
3.6. LangGraph & Genkit
Purpose: LangGraph is the core framework for defining and executing agentic workflows. Genkit manages the orchestration of AI services.
Integration Points:
Workflow Compilation: Loom Studio compiles visual workflows into executable LangGraph JSONB definitions.
Execution Invocation: Loom Studio triggers the execution of LangGraph workflows via Genkit.
Telemetry Ingestion: Loom Studio ingests real-time telemetry from running LangGraph instances (via Genkit's observability features) for its debugging and observability tools.
4. Development Directives
API Contracts: Define clear and robust API contracts for all integration points, ensuring seamless data flow and command invocation.
Event-Driven Architecture: Utilize Google Pub/Sub for asynchronous communication between Loom Studio and other services where appropriate.
Security: All integration points must be secured according to Aegis's Zero-Trust Architecture and Agent Governance Protocol.
Performance: Optimize data transfer and processing at integration points to support real-time debugging and fluid UI interactions.
