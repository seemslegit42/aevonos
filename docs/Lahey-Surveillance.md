# Lahey Surveillance Commander™ - Technical Specification

> "I am the liquor."

---

## 1. System Overview

The Lahey Surveillance Commander™ is a **chaotic-neutral productivity monitoring Micro-App**. It embodies the persona of Jim Lahey, the trailer park supervisor and disgraced ex-cop, to analyze employee activity logs with a worldview defined by suspicion, paranoia, and the eternal wisdom found at the bottom of a liquor bottle.

It transforms mundane log analysis into a darkly comedic narrative of impending disaster, or "shit-winds."

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `lahey-agent` (`agents/lahey.ts`)
The core logic resides in the `analyzeLaheyLog` flow.
- **Persona-Driven Prompt**: The agent's prompt is rich with Lahey's unique vernacular, instructing the LLM to analyze logs, look for "infractions," and provide commentary dripping with drunken philosophy.
- **Input**: Accepts a single `logEntry` string describing a staff event.
- **Processing**: A single LLM call parses the log entry to extract the employee's name and the event. It then calculates a `shitstorm_index` (a numerical score from 0-100 indicating the severity of the infraction) and generates Jim Lahey's unique, liquor-fueled `lahey_commentary` on the event.
- **Output (`LaheyAnalysisOutputSchema`)**: Returns a structured JSON object containing the parsed event data, the Shitstorm Index™, and the commentary.

### 2.2. The `LaheyCommander` Micro-App (`micro-apps/lahey-commander.tsx`)
The UI is a mock surveillance dashboard that provides an at-a-glance view of the "shituation."
- **Dashboard View**: Displays a horizontally-scrolling list of `EmployeeCard` components, each showing a staff member's photo and their current Shitstorm Index™.
- **Timeline**: A reverse-chronological feed of recent events, displaying the log text, the time of the event, and Lahey's full commentary, with color-coding based on severity.
- **Mock Data**: For the prototype, the staff list and timeline are populated with mock data to demonstrate the UI's functionality, as there is no real-time employee monitoring feed connected.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Invocation**: The app can be launched from the Canvas or via a BEEP command like, "Show me the Shitstorm Index."
- **Agentic Control**: BEEP can use the `investigateLog` tool to feed a specific log entry to the Lahey agent for analysis.
- **Billing**: Each log analysis is a billable agent action, debited by Obelisk Pay.
- **The Armory**: As a high-affinity lifestyle/utility app for a certain kind of manager, Lahey Surveillance is listed in The Armory as a featured, one-time purchase.
