# Lahey Surveillance Commander™: The Shit-Winds Monitor - Technical Specification

> "You feel that? The way the shit clings to the air, Randy?"

---

## 1. System Overview

The Lahey Surveillance Commander™ is a **satirical employee monitoring Micro-App** that analyzes user activity logs through the cynical, liquor-fueled lens of Jim Lahey. It is designed for managers who appreciate dark humor and a philosophical approach to productivity.

This is not a serious surveillance tool. It is an entertainment utility that turns log analysis into a black comedy.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `lahey-agent` (`agents/lahey.ts`)
The agent's logic is encapsulated in the `analyzeLaheyLog` flow.
- **Input**: Accepts a string `logEntry` describing a staff event (e.g., "Kyle D. opened YouTube for 22 minutes.").
- **Processing**: A single LLM call parses the log entry to extract the employee, event, and duration. It then calculates a "Shitstorm Index" (a score from 0-100 indicating the severity of the infraction) and generates Jim Lahey's unique, liquor-fueled commentary on the event.
- **Output (`LaheyAnalysisOutputSchema`)**: Returns a structured JSON object containing the parsed event details and Lahey's commentary.

### 2.2. The `LaheyCommander` Micro-App (`micro-apps/lahey-commander.tsx`)
The UI is designed as a mock surveillance dashboard.
- **Staff Dashboard**: Displays a list of mock employees with their current "Shitstorm Index" visualized as a progress bar.
- **Timeline View**: Shows a reverse-chronological feed of analyzed log events, complete with Lahey's commentary.
- **Report Builder**: Mock buttons to "Export Shituation Report," adding to the thematic experience.
- **Invocation**: Log analysis is triggered via BEEP command (e.g., "ask Lahey to investigate: [log entry]"), and the results would be pushed to update this UI in a full implementation.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Invocation**: The app can be launched from the Canvas or summoned via BEEP.
- **Agentic Control**: The `analyzeLaheyLog` tool can be used directly by BEEP, allowing for automated log analysis workflows.
- **Billing**: Each log analysis is a billable `SIMPLE_LLM` agent action, debited by Obelisk Pay.
- **The Armory**: The Lahey Surveillance Commander™ is a featured entertainment utility, available in The Armory for a one-time purchase.
