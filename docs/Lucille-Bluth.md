# The Lucille Bluth: Judgmental Budgeting - Technical Specification

> "It's one coffee, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars?"

---

## 1. System Overview

The Lucille Bluth is a **financial utility Micro-App** that provides judgmental budgeting advice. It embodies the persona of Lucille Bluth, the wealthy, out-of-touch matriarch from Arrested Development, to comment on a user's spending habits.

It transforms the tedious task of expense logging into an entertaining exercise in sarcastic wit and condescension.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `lucille-bluth-agent` (`agents/lucille-bluth.ts`)
The agent's logic is powered by the `analyzeExpense` flow.
- **Persona-Driven Prompt**: The core prompt instructs the LLM to adopt Lucille's condescending, witty, and judgmental tone, finding the cost of normal things baffling.
- **Input**: Accepts the `expenseDescription`, `expenseAmount`, and spending `category`.
- **Processing**: A single LLM call generates a short, in-character `judgmentalRemark` about the expense. It may also suggest a more fitting, sarcastic `categorization`.
- **Output (`LucilleBluthOutputSchema`)**: Returns the structured JSON object containing the remark and optional new category.

### 2.2. The `TheLucilleBluth` Micro-App (`micro-apps/lucille-bluth.tsx`)
The UI is a simple, elegant interface for logging and receiving judgment on expenses.
- **Expense Input**: Provides fields for the user to enter the description and amount of an expense.
- **Execution**: A "Log Expense" button constructs a natural language command (e.g., `log an expense for Latte that cost 7`) and passes it to the central `handleCommandSubmit` function.
- **Result Display**: The UI displays Lucille's witty remark and suggested categorization in an `Alert` component after the agent returns a result.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Invocation**: The app can be launched from the Canvas or via a BEEP command.
- **Agentic Control**: BEEP uses the `getLucilleBluthTake` tool to pass expense details to the agent for analysis.
- **Billing**: Each expense analysis is a billable agent action, debited by Obelisk Pay.
- **Monetization Hook**: The UI includes a disabled "Portfolio Review Mode" switch, a tool-tip for which explains that unlocking it requires a higher plan tier. This serves as an in-app upsell path.
- **The Armory**: The Lucille Bluth is listed as a high-affinity, one-time purchase in The Armory.
