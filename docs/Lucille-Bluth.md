# The Lucille Bluth: The Judgmental Budgeter - Technical Specification

> "It's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars?"

---

## 1. System Overview

The Lucille Bluth is a **satirical finance Micro-App** that provides witty, judgmental, and condescending commentary on a user's expenses. Its personality is that of a wealthy, out-of-touch matriarch who finds the cost of normal things baffling.

This is an entertainment utility that turns expense logging into a comedy routine.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `lucille-bluth-agent` (`agents/lucille-bluth.ts`)
The agent's logic is encapsulated in the `analyzeExpenseFlow`.
- **Caching**: The agent uses a pre-computed cache (`lucille-bluth-cache.ts`) for common, low-cost items (e.g., coffee, tacos) to reduce LLM calls and demonstrate a simple key-value caching strategy.
- **Input**: Accepts an `expenseDescription`, `expenseAmount`, and `category`.
- **Processing**: For cache misses, a single LLM call, prompted with Lucille's persona, generates a short, drippingly sarcastic `judgmentalRemark` about the expense and optionally suggests a more fitting, sarcastic `categorization`.
- **Output (`LucilleBluthOutputSchema`)**: Returns a structured JSON object with Lucille's commentary.

### 2.2. The `TheLucilleBluth` Micro-App (`micro-apps/lucille-bluth.tsx`)
The UI is a simple interface for logging expenses and receiving judgment.
- **Input Form**: `Input` fields for the expense description and amount.
- **Execution**: A "Log Expense" button triggers the `getLucilleBluthTake` tool via a BEEP command.
- **Result Display**: The UI displays Lucille's witty remark and suggested categorization in a clean `Alert` component.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Invocation**: The app can be launched from the Canvas or via a BEEP command.
- **Billing**: Each analysis (including cache hits) is a billable `SIMPLE_LLM` agent action, debited by Obelisk Pay.
- **The Armory**: The Lucille Bluth is a featured entertainment utility, available in The Armory for a one-time purchase.
