# ΛΞVON OS: Test Plan & Quality Assurance Strategy
Document Version: 1.1 (Groq & Swarm Revision)
Status: Canonized
Author: ARCHIVEX
Traceability: This document provides the quality assurance framework for all components defined in SRS-ΛΞVON-OS-v1.1.
1. Philosophy & Objective
1.1 Objective
The primary objective of this strategy is to ensure that ΛΞVON OS V1.0 is not only free of critical defects but is also stable, secure, performant, and in absolute alignment with its core doctrine. We are testing for correctness, resilience, and the integrity of the user experience.
1.2 Guiding Philosophy
Our approach to quality is built on three pillars:
Automated Guardianship: We automate relentlessly. The first line of defense against regression and error is a comprehensive suite of automated tests that run continuously.
The Human Crucible: We recognize that automated tests cannot measure the feel of the system. The psychological and economic engines require structured, qualitative validation by human testers to ensure they inspire engagement, not frustration.
Aegis-Driven Assurance: We will use our own security fabric, Aegis, as an internal QA tool. Anomalies flagged by Aegis during testing are treated as critical bugs.
2. Testing Levels & Scope
Our testing is a multi-layered defense, ensuring quality from the smallest unit to the system as a whole.
Level
Name
Scope
Methodology
Owner
L1
Unit Testing
Individual functions and components within each microservice.
Automated (Jest, Vitest). Run on pre-commit hooks.
Development Team
L2
Integration Testing
API contracts and data flow between microservices.
Automated (Supertest). Run in CI/CD pipeline on every push to main.
Development Team
L3
End-to-End (E2E) Testing
Critical user journeys through the live UI.
Automated (Playwright). Run nightly against the Staging environment.
QA Team
L4
Economic & Psychological Validation
The balance and feel of the KLEPSYDRA engine and its sub-systems.
Simulation & Manual. Performed pre-release in a controlled environment.
Economic Balance Team
L5
Security & Penetration Testing
System vulnerabilities and resilience to attack.
Automated & Manual. Continuous automated scans; quarterly manual penetration tests.
Security Team

3. Specific Test Strategies
3.1 Functional & UI/UX Testing
E2E Test Cases: The QA team will develop and maintain Playwright test suites for all critical user paths, including:
The Rite of Invocation (User Onboarding)
Micro-App installation from the Armory
A full interaction loop with a Folly Instrument (e.g., Sisyphus's Ascent)
Invoking the Sacred Gateway
A BEEP command that triggers an agentic workflow
Visual Regression Testing: Automated tools (e.g., Percy, Chromatic) will be used to ensure the Verdigris Interface Protocol™ is not violated. Snapshots of all UI components will be compared against a baseline on every commit.
3.2 Economic Balance Validation (The Monte Carlo Protocol)
Objective: To verify that the KLEPSYDRA engine's global economic dials produce the intended Retained Tribute Ratio (RTR) and Boon distribution over a statistically significant sample size.
Methodology:
A dedicated simulation service will be created to act as a virtual user population.
This service will make millions of concurrent API calls to the klepsydra-service's execute endpoint in the Staging environment.
The simulation will run against various user profiles (different SRE wave states).
The results will be aggregated and compared against the target economic models defined in the "Abacus of Fates." Any deviation greater than 2% is considered a critical failure.
3.3 Psychological Engine Validation (The Judas Crucible)
Objective: To ensure the Judas Algorithm and Aetheric Echoes are calibrated correctly and that the Aegis Psychological Safety Protocol functions as the kill switch.
Methodology: This is a manual process performed by a dedicated internal testing team.
Phase A (Baseline): Testers interact with Folly Instruments with the psychological engines disabled. They log their perceived fairness and engagement.
Phase B (Activation): The Judas Algorithm and Aetheric Echoes are enabled. Testers repeat the same interactions. They are specifically instructed to report on feelings of "near misses," "unusual luck," and "superstition."
Phase C (Frustration Test): The system's odds are temporarily skewed to induce a high loss rate. The QA team monitors the PsycheState table in the database to verify that the frustrationLevel metric rises.
Validation: The test is successful if Aegis automatically triggers the isThrottled flag for the test users once their frustrationLevel crosses the defined threshold, reverting their experience to the baseline.
3.4 Agentic Testing (The Golden Command Set)
Objective: To ensure BEEP's NLU and agentic routing remain accurate and consistent.
Methodology:
A "Golden Command Set" of 500+ unique user utterances will be maintained in a version-controlled file. This set will map each command to its expected intent, extracted parameters, and final outcome.
A nightly CI job will run this entire set against the beep-service API.
Any deviation from the expected outcome is flagged as a P1 regression and must be fixed before the next deployment.
4. Test Environment
Primary Environment: The Staging environment is the sole environment for all E2E, economic, and psychological testing. It is a 1:1 mirror of the Production infrastructure.
Data: The Staging database is seeded with a large volume of synthetically generated data that mimics production usage patterns. Under no circumstances will production data be used for testing.
5. Release Gating & Exit Criteria
A build can only be promoted from `Staging` to `Production` if it meets all of the following criteria:
* **[NEW] Agentic Performance:** The P95 end-to-end latency for the "Golden Command Set" must be **< 1000ms**. This is a non-negotiable gate.
* **Code Quality:** > 95% unit test coverage.
* **Functional Correctness:** 100% pass rate for all L3 E2E critical path tests.
* **Bug Threshold:** Zero (0) outstanding P0 or P1 bugs.
* **Economic Stability:** Successful completion of the Monte Carlo Protocol with results within a 2% tolerance of the economic model.
* **Psychological Safety:** Successful validation of the Judas Crucible and the Aegis kill switch.
* **Security:** No new critical or high vulnerabilities identified by automated scans.
This Test Plan ensures that we do not merely ship features. We ship a balanced, resilient, and trustworthy world. Quality is not a phase; it is a state of being for ΛΞVON OS.
