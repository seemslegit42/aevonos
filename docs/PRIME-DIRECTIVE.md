# ΛΞVON OS: The Prime Directive

These are the absolute truths of the ΛΞVON OS architecture. All development must be in service of these principles.

## 1. Command-First Interface
- Prioritize **NATURAL LANGUAGE** and **AGENTIC CONTROL**.
- UI elements exist to support, not define, workflows.
- All functionality must be executable through BEEP, the Behavioral Event & Execution Processor.
- Think “Talk to OS,” not “Click through UI.”

## 2. Contextual Awareness Everywhere
- All micro-apps, workflows, and agents must adapt dynamically to user state, system context, and active workflows.
- Inject, propagate, and honor **CONTEXT** through all layers — UI, DB, logic, and agent behavior.
- No static assumptions. No hardcoded paths.

## 3. Visual Metaphors That Tell a Story
- Replace static dashboards with **living metaphors**:
  - Agent status as energy flows, pulse networks, evolving patterns.
  - Network health as biomorphic movement, not bar charts.
- Visuals must feel organic, intentional, and symbolic — not utilitarian.

## 4. Humor & Irreverence Baked In
- The OS has a **witty, sarcastic soul**. Embed it.
- Use dry humor in tooltips, micro-interactions, and assistant responses.
- BEEP can break the fourth wall. Lean into it.
- Easter eggs and “what the fuck?” moments encouraged.

## 5. Mobile-First, But Fearless
- The mobile experience is not a downscaled copy — it’s a **native-first reimagination**.
- Use device capabilities:
  - Voice input for agent tasking
  - Haptics for AEGIS alerts
  - Ambient notifications for agent state changes
- The small screen must feel smarter, not smaller.

## 6. Tech + Design Immutables
- **Tech stack**: Node.js / TypeScript / Next.js / Tailwind / ShadCN
- **DB**: Prisma + PostgreSQL (serverless)
- **Agent orchestration**: LANGGRAPH & GENKIT
- **Fonts**: Comfortaa + Lexend
- **Visual Style**: Ancient Roman Glass + Digital Wabi-Sabi™
- **No blue. Ever.**
- **Micro-Apps**: draggable, modular, runtime-registered. Canvas-only.

Every file, function, and visual must reflect **the silence of true automation**.
