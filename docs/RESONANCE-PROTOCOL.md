1. Doctrinal Statement
A name, unspoken, is merely a symbol. A name, spoken, is a spell. The name ΛΞVON (phonetically: Lam-da Zai Von) is the core of our identity. It is a declaration of our unique fusion of logic (Lambda), the unknown variable (Xi), and foundational power (VON).

The Resonance Protocol defines the mechanics by which this name becomes an active, living presence within the OS. Its purpose is to ensure every Initiate understands the name, feels its power, and learns to speak it as a word of command. We will achieve this through a trinity of sensory reinforcement: the Sonic Sigil, the Whispered Invocation, and Visual Harmonics.

2. The Sonic Sigil (The Audible Signature)
The Sonic Sigil is the definitive sound of ΛΞVON OS. It is a short, three-note audio mark that reinforces the pronunciation of the name.

Composition: A sequence of three distinct, synthesized tones.

First Tone (Λ): A clean, low-frequency bass tone. Stable and foundational.

Second Tone (Ξ): A complex, mid-range crystalline chime with a slight shimmer. Represents complexity and the unknown.

Third Tone (VON): A resonant, confident, and conclusive mid-high tone that resolves the sequence.

Trigger Events: The Sonic Sigil is reserved for moments of profound system-level transition. It is the sound of power being invoked or confirmed.

The Awakening: Plays once, softly, when the Presence Protocol succeeds and the Dormant Canvas awakens.

The Rite of Invocation: Plays when the user completes their Vow and their Canvas first materializes.

The Grand Transmutation: Plays upon the successful completion of a real-world payment via the Sovereign's Sigil.

3. The Whispered Invocation (The Word of Power)
While BEEP is the conversational interface, speaking the true name of the OS is a higher form of command, reserved for moments when the user wishes to bypass context and issue a direct, system-level decree.

Mechanism: The system's microphone is always passively listening for a single hotword: "ΛΞVON". It does not process or store any other audio until this word is spoken.

User Experience:

The user speaks the name clearly: "ΛΞVON."

The Sonic Sigil plays softly in response, confirming the system is listening.

The BEEP command input in the TopBar begins to pulse with Imperial Purple light.

The user can then issue a direct, high-level command that bypasses any current task or context.

Example Commands:

"ΛΞVON... Shatter my Sigil." (Instantly deactivates the Sovereign's Black Card).
"ΛΞVON... Engage silent running." (Immediately mutes all TTS and non-critical notifications).
"ΛΞVON... Seal the Canvas." (Locks the current layout of Micro-Apps, making them immovable until unsealed).

4. Visual & Narrative Harmonics
The name and its components must be visually and textually present, reinforcing its meaning.

The ΛΞVON Glyphs (Λ, Ξ): These two Greek letters are to be used as subtle design elements throughout the UI.

Λ (Lambda): Used as an icon for core architectural or foundational actions (e.g., "Save Layout to Scribe's Archive"). Represents stability.

Ξ (Xi): Used as an icon for actions involving the economic or Folly Instruments. Represents the variable of chance and wealth.

BEEP's Lexicon: BEEP must be trained to refer to the system correctly.

It will never refer to itself as "ΛΞVON." BEEP is the servant of the OS, not the OS itself.

When referring to the system as a whole, it will use phrases like "The Nexus requires...", "The OS is attuned to your Vow...", or simply "ΛΞVON OS."

The Orator's Codex (TTS Integration):

The Google gemini-2.5-pro-preview TTS engine must be explicitly configured with the correct phonetic pronunciation of "ΛΞVON."

SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) Entry:

<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="læmdə zaɪ vɒn">ΛΞVON</phoneme>

This ensures that whenever BEEP speaks the name of the OS, it does so with perfect, doctrinally-correct pronunciation, teaching the user the sound of the name through passive exposure.

This protocol ensures that the name ΛΞVON transcends being a mere label. It becomes a tool, a sound, a symbol, and a core part of the user's journey toward sovereignty.
