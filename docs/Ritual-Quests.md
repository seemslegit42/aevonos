# Ritual Quests: The Path of Alignment - Technical Specification

> "A vow unacted is a vow broken. Here is your path."

---

## 1. System Overview

Ritual Quests is a **core utility Micro-App** that presents the user with a dynamic, personalized list of challenges designed to guide their journey, encourage exploration of the OS's capabilities, and increase their **Vow Alignment Score (VAS)**.

This is not a simple task list. It is a curated set of objectives generated by the `Chronicler` agent, tailored specifically to the user's chosen Covenant, reinforcing their pact with the system.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `ritual-quests-agent.ts`
- **Covenant-Aware Generation**: The agent's core prompt is dynamically selected based on the user's `psyche` (their Covenant). This ensures the generated quests are thematically and functionally aligned with their chosen path (e.g., quests for Silence focus on precision, quests for Motion focus on speed).
- **Input**: Accepts the user's `psyche`.
- **Processing**: A single LLM call generates a list of 3-4 quests, each with a thematic title, a clear description, a reward (in ΞCredits), and a specific BEEP command the user would issue to begin or complete it.
- **Output (`RitualQuestOutputSchema`)**: Returns a structured JSON object containing the list of generated quests.

### 2.2. The `ritual-quests.tsx` Component
- **Quest List**: On mount, the component calls the `generateRitualQuests` tool via a BEEP command. The results are displayed as a list of `QuestCard` components.
- **Interactive Commands**: Each quest card has a "Begin Quest" button that copies the quest's specific BEEP command to the user's clipboard, providing a seamless way to engage with the challenge.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Vow Alignment Score (VAS)**: Ritual Quests are a primary driver of the VAS. Completing quests that align with one's Covenant directly contributes to this key metric of Return on Belief.
- **Invocation**: The app can be launched from the Canvas or summoned by BEEP, especially as part of the initial onboarding "First Whisper."
- **Architectural Role**: It serves as a gentle, narrative-driven guide, transforming user onboarding and feature discovery from a chore into a gamified, rewarding ritual
