1. Introduction
(No changes to this section)

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
ΛΞVON OS is a cloud-native, AI-first, agentic operating system built on a microservices architecture. Its conversational and agentic capabilities are explicitly designed around the Groq LPU to deliver near-zero latency, making the user interaction feel instantaneous. This is a hard architectural constraint.

2.2 User Characteristics
(No changes to this section)

2.3 General Constraints
Technology Stack: The stack is locked: Node.js/TypeScript, Next.js, LangGraph, Genkit, PostgreSQL (Serverless), Prisma, DragonflyDB, Supabase (for 3rd parties).

Inference Engine: The Groq LPU is the mandatory inference engine for all primary agentic reasoning performed by the beep-service and for the security analysis functions within the aegis-service.

Security Posture: A Zero-Trust security model is mandatory. All access is governed by the Identity & Access Protocol.

3. System Architecture
3.1 Architectural Model: Microservices
ΛΞVON OS is implemented as a distributed system of microservices. The orchestration of these services is managed by the beep-service operating on Swarm AI principles, treating each downstream service as a specialized agent in a collective.

3.2 Backend Architecture
auth-service: Manages user identity via the Rite of Invocation (passwordless magic link) and the Presence Protocol (biometric-signed challenge). Issues the "Two Keys" (Core JWT and Supabase JWT).

beep-service: The agentic core. It parses natural language input and uses LangGraph to define workflows. It executes these workflows by making near-instantaneous reasoning calls to the Groq LPU. It orchestrates a swarm of other services (agents) to gather data and perform actions. It is the mandatory intermediary for all critical actions as per the Phalanx Protocol.

aegis-service: The security engine. Subscribes to event streams from all services. It uses the Groq LPU to perform real-time intent analysis on suspicious commands to detect social engineering threats (Phalanx Protocol). It also monitors economic activity and user psychological state.

4. System Features (Technical Specifications)
4.1 Identity & Access
SRS-ID-1 (Presence Protocol): The auth-service must expose an endpoint (e.g., /v1/auth/awaken) that accepts a signed nonce. It must interface with aegis-service to verify the nonce has not been replayed before issuing a Core JWT. The Workstation App and Mobile Companion must implement the necessary local network discovery and cryptographic signing flow.

SRS-ID-2 (Phalanx Final Vow): The beep-service must identify commands tagged as "System Critical." Before executing, it must initiate a push notification to the user's Mobile Companion, which then requires biometric approval to release a single-use authorization token back to BEEP.

4.2 Aegis Security Fabric
SRS-AEGIS-1 (Intent Scrutiny): The aegis-service must expose an internal endpoint (e.g., /v1/aegis/scrutinize). Before executing a command with external data, the beep-service must call this endpoint. The aegis-service will then construct a security prompt, send it to the Groq LPU, and return a threat score. If the score exceeds the threshold, beep-service must abort the command and trigger the Sentinel persona.

5. External Interface Requirements
5.1 Software Interfaces
LLM Integration (Groq): The beep-service and aegis-service must use the Genkit library to interface with the Groq API. The API endpoint for Groq is a critical system dependency. All prompt chains must be optimized for single-round-turnaround to maximize speed.

Database (PostgreSQL): All services interacting with the core database must use the Prisma Client and connect via the Prisma Accelerate connection string.

Cache (DragonflyDB): Services requiring high-speed caching (auth-service, canvas-service, klepsydra-service) must use a compatible Redis client to connect to the DragonflyDB instance.

6. Other Non-Functional Requirements
6.1 Performance
The system's performance is a core functional requirement. These NFRs provide the specific, measurable targets.

Agentic Latency: The P95 latency for a beep-service command execution (from request receipt to response initiation, including the call to the Groq API) must be less than 750ms.

End-to-End User Experience: The P95 latency for a user submitting a command and seeing a textual and audible response in the UI must be less than 1000ms.

Presence Protocol Awakening: The time from successful biometric authentication on the Mobile Companion to the Workstation Canvas becoming fully "Awake" must be less than 1500ms.
