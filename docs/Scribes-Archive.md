# The Scribe's Archive: The Sentient Library - Technical Specification

> "Every action leaves an echo. This is where we listen."

---

## 1. System Overview

The Scribe's Archive is a **core utility Micro-App** that serves as the visual metaphor for the unified data layer within ΛΞVON OS. It is designed to feel like a sentient, crystalline library where data is not stored in folders, but exists as living "data crystals" that can be summoned, inspected, and reasoned over by BEEP.

This is not a file explorer. It is an interactive representation of the system's memory, a "digital zen garden" where the user can find tranquility in the order of their information.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `file-explorer.tsx` Component
- **Data Crystals**: The UI renders a collection of floating, gently pulsating "data crystals" in a 3D space, each representing a significant data artifact (e.g., a contract, a report, an ingested document).
- **Tool-Tipped Metadata**: Hovering over a crystal reveals its core metadata (name, date, originating agent, Aegis integrity status) in a tooltip.
- **BEEP as the Interface**: The Archive has no search bar or traditional navigation. The user interacts with it by issuing commands to BEEP (e.g., "BEEP, show me all contracts from Q3," "Find the report generated by The Auditor last week"). BEEP filters and highlights the relevant crystals in response.

### 2.2. Backend Integration
- **`/api/data/artifacts`**: This is a mock API endpoint that the component would call to fetch the list of data crystals to render. In a full implementation, this would query a metadata database that logs all significant data artifacts created by agents.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Central Data Layer**: The Archive is the visual front-end for the OS's unified data layer, making an abstract concept tangible and interactive.
- **Agentic Interaction**: It is a prime example of a Micro-App designed for agent-first interaction. Its primary utility is unlocked through conversation with BEEP, not through direct manipulation.
- **Architectural Role**: It reinforces the core doctrine of moving away from traditional file/folder structures towards a more intelligent, context-aware data environment. The user doesn't need to know *where* something
