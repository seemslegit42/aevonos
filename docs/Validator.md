# Uncut Truth Engine: The Validator - Technical Specification

> "The hash does not lie. The artifact is either pure, or it is corrupt. There is no in-between."

---

## 1. System Overview

The Uncut Truth Engine is a **core security utility Micro-App** that serves as a public-facing tool for the `Aegis` subsystem. Its sole purpose is to verify the integrity of a digital artifact (like an exported dossier) by comparing its SHA256 hash against a provided signature.

This is a critical tool for establishing trust and provenance, allowing any party to confirm that a document generated by ΛΞVON OS has not been tampered with.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `validator.tsx` Component
The UI is a simple, two-part interface for submitting an artifact and its hash for verification.
- **File Input**: A drag-and-drop area and file browser allows the user to upload the file they wish to validate.
- **Hash Input**: A text field for the user to paste the expected SHA256 hash (e.g., copied from an `Export Dossier` panel).
- **Client-Side Hashing**: When the user clicks "Verify Integrity," the app reads the file content *entirely on the client-side* using the `FileReader` API. It then uses a library like `crypto-js` to calculate the SHA256 hash of the file's contents.
- **Result Display**: The component compares the calculated hash with the user-provided hash and displays a clear "Success" or "Failure" message, indicating whether the file's integrity is confirmed.

### 2.2. Security
- **No Data Transmission**: The Validator is designed for maximum security. The contents of the uploaded file are never transmitted to the server. All hashing and comparison happens locally in the user's browser, ensuring the privacy of the document being verified.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Aegis Provenance**: This tool is the final link in the chain of trust established by `Aegis`. When an agent generates a secure artifact, it provides a hash. The Validator is the public utility that anyone can use to confirm that hash.
- **Architectural Role**: It serves as a decentralized, trustless verification tool, reinforcing the OS's commitment to security, transparency, and data integrity. It allows users to prove the authenticity of their ΛΞVON-generated documents to any third party.
