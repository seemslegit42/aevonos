# The Winston Wolfe: The Fixer - Technical Specification

> "I'm thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten."

## 1. System Overview

The Winston Wolfe is a **specialized problem-solving Micro-App** that acts as a reputation management "fixer." Inspired by the legendary character, this agent is calm, direct, and ruthlessly efficient, providing concise solutions to complex problems, particularly negative online reviews.

This is not a customer service chatbot. This is a problem-solver who arrives, fixes the situation, and leaves.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `winston-wolfe-agent` (`agents/winston-wolfe.ts`)
The agent's logic is encapsulated in the `generateSolution` flow.
- **Input**: Accepts the `reviewText` of a negative online review.
- **Processing**: A single LLM call analyzes the problem from the customer's perspective. It avoids apologies or defensive language, instead focusing on a calm, direct, and disarming response that acknowledges the issue and proposes a simple, effective solution.
- **Output (`WinstonWolfeOutputSchema`)**: Returns a single, concise `suggestedResponse` string.

### 2.2. The `WinstonWolfe` Micro-App (`micro-apps/winston-wolfe.tsx`)
The UI is a clean, no-nonsense interface for problem submission.
- **Problem Input**: A `Textarea` for the user to paste the negative review.
- **Execution**: A "Call The Fixer" button that triggers the `solveReputationProblem` tool via a BEEP command.
- **Solution Display**: The UI renders the `suggestedResponse` from the agent in a clean, easily readable format for the user to copy and paste.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Invocation**: The app can be launched from the Canvas or via a BEEP command.
- **Billing**: Each solution generated is a billable `SIMPLE_LLM` agent action, debited by Obelisk Pay.
- **The Armory**: The Winston Wolfe is a high-value utility for any business with a public-facing presence, available as a one-time purchase in The Armory.
