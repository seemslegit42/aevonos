# **App Name**: ΛΞVON OS

## Core Features:

- Agentic Brain: BEEP: Conversational command core for natural-language system control, intent parsing, workflow orchestration, and contextual awareness.
- Live Workspace: Canvas Layer: Persistent workspace for Micro-Apps, reflecting the current work thread orchestrated by BEEP.
- Global Control Strip: TopBar: Persistent global control strip with the ΛΞVON logo, central BEEP input field, and text-only status/session info.
- Atomic Utility Units: Micro-Apps: Modular, single-purpose, dynamically registered, context-aware functional units within the Canvas, agent-controllable.
- AI-Powered Cybersecurity: Aegis: Built-in, always-on cybersecurity layer tracking session anomalies, suspicious workflow behavior, and access boundaries using anomaly detection as a tool.
- Visual Command Center: Loom Studio: Visual command center for building, testing, and manipulating LangGraph workflows, prompt chains, and agent behaviors.

## Style Guidelines:

- Dynamic Iridescent Aurora gradient blending Imperial Purple (#6A0DAD), Patina Green (#3EB991), and Roman Aqua (#20B2AA) over Obsidian Black (#000000).
- Vitreous White (#F0F8FF) and Conchoidal Gray (#808080) for neutral UI elements.
- Gilded Accent (#FFD700) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Headings font: 'Comfortaa', a rounded sans-serif.
- Body and UI font: 'Lexend', a sans-serif, optimized for readability.
- Micro-Apps use Crystalline Glyphs—faceted forms, rich internal glow (Roman Aqua/Patina Green gradients), engraved & polished feel, unique silhouettes.
- Ancient Roman Glass Aesthetic: Embraces imperfect symmetry, purposeful spacing, soft shadows, and brutalist-zen balance.
- Subtle animations for Micro-App transitions and agent actions to enhance the sense of dynamic orchestration.
