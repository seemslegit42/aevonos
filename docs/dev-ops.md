ΛΞVON OS: DevOps - CI/CD Strategy
1. Introduction: Automating the Flow of Innovation
The CI/CD strategy for ΛΞVON OS is designed to support our modular, microservices-oriented architecture and rapid development cycles. It ensures that changes are integrated, tested, and deployed efficiently and securely, embodying the "silence of true automation" in our development process.
2. Core Principles
Automation First: Minimize manual intervention at every stage of the pipeline.
Rapid Feedback: Provide quick feedback to developers on code quality and integration issues.
Consistency: Ensure consistent builds and deployments across development, staging, and production environments.
Security Integrated: Embed security checks throughout the pipeline, reinforcing the Aegis "build like he's watching" directive.
Reliability: Build resilient pipelines that can recover from failures and ensure successful deployments.
Traceability: Maintain comprehensive logs and audit trails for all changes and deployments.
3. Tooling and Platform Stack
Cloud Provider: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) [cite: 113 (nexOS Tech Arch)].
Containerization: Docker [cite: 113 (nexOS Tech Arch)].
Orchestration: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for backend microservices [cite: 113 (nexOS Tech Arch)].
CI/CD Orchestrator: GitHub Actions [cite: 113 (nexOS Tech Arch)] for automated testing and deployments.
Frontend Deployment: Vercel (for Next.js frontend and API Routes/Edge Functions) [cite: 8.8 (Nexus Tech Arch)].
Backend Microservices Deployment: Platforms like Railway, Render, or Koyeb (leveraging their native Git-based deployment capabilities) [cite: 8.8 (Nexus Tech Arch)].
Monorepo Management: Turborepo for optimizing build times and task execution across different applications and shared packages within the monorepo [cite: 8.8 (Nexus Tech Arch)].
Package Manager: pnpm for efficient package management [cite: 8.8 (Nexus Tech Arch)].
Testing Frameworks: Vitest (TS/React unit/integration), Pytest (FastAPI unit/integration), Playwright (E2E) [cite: 8.8 (Nexus Tech Arch)].
Code Quality: ESLint (JS/TS/React), Prettier (formatting), Ruff (Python linting/formatting) [cite: 8.8 (Nexus Tech Arch)].
Error Tracking: Sentry for real-time error monitoring [cite: 8.8 (Nexus Tech Arch)].
Analytics: Plausible or Vercel Analytics for frontend monitoring [cite: 8.8 (Nexus Tech Arch)].
4. CI/CD Pipeline Stages
The CI/CD pipeline for ΛΞVON OS is structured into distinct, automated stages triggered by Git events.
4.1. Continuous Integration (CI)
Trigger: Push to feature branches, Pull Request (PR) creation/updates.
Stages:
Code Linting & Formatting:
Action: Run ESLint, Prettier, and Ruff across affected code.
Outcome: Ensures code quality, consistency, and adherence to coding standards. Fails fast on stylistic errors.
Unit & Integration Tests:
Action: Execute unit tests (Vitest for TS/React, Pytest for FastAPI) and targeted integration tests.
Outcome: Validates individual components and service interactions.
Security Static Analysis (SAST):
Action: Run static code analysis tools (SAST) to identify common security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
Outcome: Proactive identification of security flaws before deployment, reinforcing Aegis.
Build Artifacts:
Frontend: Build Next.js application (including API Routes/Edge Functions) for Vercel deployment.
Backend: Build Docker images for Node.js/TypeScript and Python FastAPI microservices.
Outcome: Creates deployable artifacts, cached where possible by Turborepo for efficiency.
4.2. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
Trigger: Merge to main branch (for automatic deployment to staging) or creation of a release tag (for production).
Environments:
Development: Branch-based deployments (e.g., Vercel preview URLs for frontend, ephemeral backend environments).
Staging: Automated deployment from main branch. Reflects production environment for final testing.
Production: Manual approval after successful staging tests and release candidate validation.
Stages (for Staging/Production):
Deployment to Environment:
Frontend: Deploy Next.js application to Vercel.
Backend Microservices: Deploy Docker images to GKE/target platforms (Railway, Render, Koyeb).
Outcome: Updates the application in the target environment.
Post-Deployment Health Checks:
Action: Automated checks (e.g., API endpoint health, service responsiveness, basic functional checks).
Outcome: Ensures the deployed application is running and accessible.
End-to-End (E2E) Tests:
Action: Execute Playwright tests against the deployed environment to validate critical user flows.
Outcome: Confirms end-to-end functionality and user experience.
Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):
Action: Run DAST tools against the deployed application to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
Outcome: Catches security issues that SAST might miss, strengthening Aegis's vigilance.
Performance Testing:
Action: Run automated performance tests to ensure new deployments meet responsiveness and scalability targets.
Outcome: Prevents performance regressions.
Monitoring & Alerting Configuration:
Action: Verify Sentry and analytics tools are correctly configured for the new deployment.
Outcome: Ensures continuous observability and rapid error detection post-deployment.
5. Security Integrations within CI/CD (Aegis in the Pipeline)
Aegis is our "always-on bodyguard," integrated at multiple points in the CI/CD pipeline:
SAST (Static Analysis): In the CI stage, identifying vulnerabilities in code.
Dependency Scanning: Checking for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
DAST (Dynamic Analysis): In the CD stage, testing the running application for vulnerabilities.
Secrets Management: Securely handling API keys and credentials, preventing hardcoding.
Immutable Artifacts: Ensuring Docker images are scanned and immutable, reducing attack surface.
Audit Trails: Comprehensive logging of all pipeline activities for traceability and compliance.
6. Rollback Strategy
Automation: Maintain automated rollback capabilities for each deployment.
Version Control: Leverage Git for easy reversion to previous stable commits.
Container Orchestration: GKE and other platforms' native rollback features will be utilized.
Database Migrations: Plan for backward-compatible database migrations or automated rollback scripts where schema changes are involved.
