# ΛΞVON OS: DevOps - CI/CD Strategy

## 1. Introduction: Automating the Flow of Innovation

The CI/CD strategy for ΛΞVON OS is designed to support our monolithic Next.js architecture and rapid development cycles. It ensures that changes are integrated, tested, and deployed efficiently and securely, embodying the "silence of true automation" in our development process.

## 2. Core Principles

-   **Automation First**: Minimize manual intervention at every stage of the pipeline.
-   **Rapid Feedback**: Provide quick feedback to developers on code quality and integration issues.
-   **Consistency**: Ensure consistent builds and deployments across all environments.
-   **Security Integrated**: Embed security checks throughout the pipeline, reinforcing the Aegis "build like he's watching" directive.
-   **Reliability**: Build resilient pipelines that can recover from failures and ensure successful deployments.
-   **Traceability**: Maintain comprehensive logs and audit trails for all changes and deployments.

## 3. Tooling and Platform Stack

-   **Cloud Provider**: Vercel (for frontend and serverless functions) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for database hosting.
-   **CI/CD Orchestrator**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployments.
-   **Frontend Deployment**: Vercel (for Next.js frontend and API Routes/Edge Functions).
-   **Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL (e.g., Neon, Supabase, or Vercel Postgres) with Prisma as the ORM.
-   **Package Manager**: `pnpm` for efficient package management.
-   **Testing Frameworks**: `jest` or `vitest` for unit/integration testing, `playwright` for E2E testing.
-   **Code Quality**: ESLint for TypeScript/React, Prettier for formatting.
-   **Error Tracking**: Sentry or a similar service for real-time error monitoring.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline Stages

The CI/CD pipeline for ΛΞVON OS is structured into distinct, automated stages triggered by Git events.

### 4.1. Continuous Integration (CI)

-   **Trigger**: Push to feature branches, Pull Request (PR) creation/updates.
-   **Stages**:
    1.  **Code Linting & Formatting**:
        -   **Action**: Run ESLint and Prettier across the codebase.
        -   **Outcome**: Ensures code quality, consistency, and adherence to standards. Fails fast on stylistic errors.
    2.  **Unit & Integration Tests**:
        -   **Action**: Execute unit and integration tests.
        -   **Outcome**: Validates individual components and service interactions.
    3.  **Build Application**:
        -   **Action**: Run `pnpm build` to compile the Next.js application.
        -   **Outcome**: Ensures the application builds successfully without errors.
    4.  **Security Static Analysis (SAST)**:
        -   **Action**: Run static code analysis tools (e.g., Snyk, CodeQL) to identify common security vulnerabilities.
        -   **Outcome**: Proactive identification of security flaws before deployment.

### 4.2. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)

-   **Trigger**: Merge to `main` branch (for automatic deployment to production/staging).
-   **Environments**:
    -   **Preview**: Vercel automatically creates preview deployments for every PR.
    -   **Production**: Merging to the `main` branch triggers a production deployment on Vercel.
-   **Stages**:
    1.  **Deployment to Vercel**:
        -   **Action**: GitHub Actions trigger a Vercel deployment.
        -   **Outcome**: Updates the application in the target environment.
    2.  **Database Migration**:
        -   **Action**: `prisma migrate deploy` is run as part of the Vercel build process.
        -   **Outcome**: The production database schema is updated to match the latest version.
    3.  **Post-Deployment Health Checks**:
        -   **Action**: Automated checks to ensure the deployed application is running and accessible.
        -   **Outcome**: Verifies basic deployment success.
    4.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**:
        -   **Action**: Execute Playwright tests against the deployed preview or production environment to validate critical user flows.
        -   **Outcome**: Confirms end-to-end functionality and user experience.

## 5. Security Integrations within CI/CD (Aegis in the Pipeline)

Aegis is our "always-on bodyguard," integrated at multiple points in the CI/CD pipeline:

-   **SAST (Static Analysis)**: In the CI stage, identifying vulnerabilities in code.
-   **Dependency Scanning**: Using tools like `npm audit` or GitHub's Dependabot to check for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
-   **Secrets Management**: Securely handling API keys and credentials using environment variables (e.g., Vercel Environment Variables), preventing hardcoding.
-   **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all pipeline activities for traceability and compliance.

## 6. Rollback Strategy

-   **Vercel Instant Rollbacks**: Leverage Vercel's native capability to instantly revert to a previous production deployment if issues are detected.
-   **Database Migrations**: Plan for backward-compatible database schema changes. For breaking changes, a more coordinated migration strategy is required. `prisma migrate` helps manage this process.
