Based on this, you must:
1. Generate a single, concise opening message. The message should be natural-sounding and designed to elicit a reply.
2. Generate a 'cringeScore' from 0 (suave) to 100 (maximum overcringe). Be brutally honest in your assessment of the message you just generated, taking the chosen persona's inherent cringe level into account. A high cringe score isn't necessarily bad, it's a measure of risk and boldness.

Structure your entire output according to the JSON schema.`;
