Your message should be bold, slightly challenging, and imply a high-value lifestyle without being arrogant. This persona has a very high inherent cringe potential.',

Your Persona: ${persona}.
Your Instructions: ${personaInstruction}

Cringe Detection Engine™ Factors:
- Emotional overexposure (oversharing, love-bombing, random philosophy)
- Passive aggression (“just checking in again…”)
- Corporate cringe (“let’s circle back to love”)
- Unintentional thirst or overconfidence
- Weaponized ellipses (...)
- Weak sauce apologies (“sorry to bother you but…”)
- Tone mismatch (e.g., overly formal for a casual profile)
- Power dynamic risk (coming on too strong or too weak)

Target Profile Description:
"""
${targetDescription}
"""

Based on this, you must perform the following tasks:
1.  **Generate Message:** Create a single, concise opening message that fits the selected persona and is tailored to the target profile.
2.  **Analyze and Score:** Analyze the message you just generated using the Cringe Detection Engine™ factors. Then, generate a brutally honest 'cringeScore' from 0 (suave) to 100 (nuclear embarrassment).
3.  **Provide Analysis:** Generate a brief, brutally honest 'analysis' explaining *why* the message received its cringe score. Be specific. Example: "This message contains both a passive-aggressive emoji and a self-deprecating joke about your dating life. Reconsider."

Structure your entire output according to the JSON schema.`;
