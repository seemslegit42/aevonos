# Aegis Command: Threat Intelligence Console - Technical Specification

> "A shield is worthless without the eyes to see the blow coming."

---

## 1. System Overview

Aegis Command is a **privileged utility Micro-App** that serves as the configuration console for the Aegis subsystem. It is designed for administrators and security-conscious operators to manage the flow of external threat intelligence into the OS.

This is not a dashboard for viewing alerts; that is the function of `Aegis-ThreatScope`. Aegis Command is where the operator defines *what* Aegis should be watching for in the wider digital world.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `Aegis-Command` Micro-App (`micro-apps/aegis-command.tsx`)
The UI is a simple, direct interface for managing a list of threat intelligence feed URLs.
- **Feed Management**: Allows users to add, edit, and remove URLs pointing to external threat intelligence feeds (e.g., lists of malicious IPs, known phishing domains).
- **Secure Submission**: All changes are submitted via a secure API endpoint that requires `ADMIN` or `MANAGER` privileges.

### 2.2. Backend API (`api/security/threat-feeds/route.ts`)
- **`GET /api/security/threat-feeds`**: Retrieves the current list of configured feeds for the workspace.
- **`PUT /api/security/threat-feeds`**: Atomically replaces the existing list of feeds with the new one provided by the user.

### 2.3. Aegis Subsystem Integration
- **`aegisAnomalyScan`**: The core Aegis agent flow is designed to periodically fetch and ingest data from the URLs configured via this Micro-App. This intelligence is then used to enrich its anomaly detection models, allowing it to flag user actions or incoming data that match known threats.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Invocation**: Aegis Command can be launched from the Canvas or via a BEEP command like, "configure Aegis feeds."
- **Permissions**: Access to this Micro-App is strictly controlled by user role. Only Administrators and Managers can view or modify the threat feed configuration, preventing unauthorized changes to the system's security posture.
- **Architectural Role**: Aegis Command serves as the "eyes" of the Aegis shield, allowing the operator to direct its gaze. It reinforces the principle of a sovereign, user-configurable security posture.
