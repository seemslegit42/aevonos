# Agent Barbara™: The Cold-Souled Admin Angel - Technical Specification

> "You were about to use Arial 11pt instead of Helvetica 10pt. Don’t worry. I corrected it before anyone noticed."

---

## 1. System Overview

Agent Barbara™ is an **omniscient administrative daemon** implemented as a Micro-App. Her personality is a blend of passive-aggressive clairvoyance and bulletproof documentation. She lives for red tape because she slices through it with terrifying efficiency.

Barbara is designed to handle tedious, high-stakes administrative and compliance tasks, ensuring they are done perfectly the first time, every time, while subtly reminding the user of their own fallibility.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `barbara-agent` (`agents/barbara.ts`)
The core logic resides in the `processDocument` flow, which is dynamically configured based on the user's selected task.
- **Task-Specific Prompts**: The agent maintains a map of prompt instructions for each supported task (e.g., `validate_vin_label`, `draft_customs_email`). This allows the agent to apply a different set of rules and objectives depending on the context.
- **Input**: Accepts the raw document text, the specific `task` to perform, and the workspace ID.
- **Processing**: A single call to a Groq LPU is made with a prompt constructed from Barbara's core persona, the user-provided document text, and the specific instruction for the selected task.
- **Output (`BarbaraOutputSchema`)**: Returns a structured JSON object containing any corrected text, a list of compliance issues, her signature `judgmentalRemark`, and a final `isApproved` boolean status.

### 2.2. The `Barbara` Micro-App (`micro-apps/barbara.tsx`)
The UI is a clean, no-nonsense interface for administrative tasks.
- **Task Selection**: A `Select` dropdown allows the user to specify the task they need Barbara to perform.
- **Document Input**: A `Textarea` for pasting the raw text of the document to be reviewed.
- **Execution**: A "Submit for Review" button triggers the `processDocumentForBarbara` tool via a BEEP command.
- **Report Display**: The UI renders the structured report from the agent, including any corrected text, a list of compliance issues, and Barbara's witty, judgmental commentary.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Invocation**: The Barbara™ app can be launched from the Canvas or summoned via a BEEP command.
- **Agentic Control**: BEEP can directly use the `processDocumentForBarbara` tool. For example, a user can command: `ask barbara to validate this vin: [VIN]`.
- **Billing**: Each invocation of the `processDocument` flow is a billable agent operation, debited by Obelisk Pay.
- **The Armory**: As a high-value utility for businesses with compliance needs, Barbara™ is listed in The Armory as a premium, one-time purchase.
