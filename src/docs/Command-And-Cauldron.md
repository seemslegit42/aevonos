# Command & Cauldron™: The Sovereign Security Platform

> "The Cauldron is not a part of the OS. It is a pact made with a higher power. It is an oath, written in credit and enforced by code."

## 1. System Overview: An External Power

Command & Cauldron™ is a **fully standalone, sovereign security platform** designed for enterprise-grade, programmable security and behavioral enforcement.

**It is NOT a Micro-App.** It is an entirely separate application that integrates with ΛΞVON OS through a privileged, secure API. It has its own infrastructure, its own interface, and its own arcane logic. Think of it as the ultimate third-party integration—a specialized security oracle that ΛΞVON OS can consult.

## 2. Access Control & Monetization

Access to the Cauldron is strictly governed by the doctrine of **"No Sovereignty, No Spell."**

-   **Gated by Sovereignty Class**: The interactive features of the `Command & Cauldron` Micro-App are only available to users with the `ADMIN` role (representing the Architect or a high-ranking user). Lower-ranked users will see a locked or teaser view.
-   **ΞCredit Costs**: Every ritual invocation has a defined ΞCredit cost. This cost is calculated and displayed within the Micro-App interface.
-   **Pre-Execution Billing**: Before an agent can invoke a ritual, it MUST first successfully debit the user's workspace account for the full cost via Obelisk Pay. If the debit fails (e.g., due to insufficient funds), the ritual is aborted.
-   **Tier-Specific Features**: Advanced capabilities, such as binding rituals to external proxies or using multi-agent logic, are reserved for users on the `Priesthood` plan. These features will be visibly disabled in the UI for lower-tier users.
-   **Audit Logging**: Every successful invocation is logged as a transaction in the user's Ξconomy Ledger. Any unauthorized attempt to access or invoke a ritual is flagged and logged as a security anomaly for Aegis to review.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

-   **Acquisition**: Access is granted by first acquiring the "Cauldron Pact" from The Armory. This is a high-cost, one-time purchase that unlocks the ability to integrate.
-   **Agentic Invocation**: Once integrated, privileged agents within ΛΞVON OS (like BEEP) gain access to a new tool: `invokeCauldronRitual`.
-   **Aegis Symbiosis**: Before executing a critical action, Aegis can be configured to call the Cauldron via this tool to ensure the action does not violate a forged ritual, adding an unparalleled layer of customizable, dynamic security.
-   **The Flow of Power**: ΛΞVON OS proposes an action -> BEEP/Aegis invokes the Cauldron's API with the action's context -> The Cauldron's external engine evaluates it against its rituals -> It returns a verdict (ALLOW / DENY / LOG) -> ΛΞVON OS enforces the verdict.

This architecture correctly positions Command & Cauldron not as a feature, but as the ultimate security allegiance a sovereign operator can make.
