### 1. The Strategic Imperative

The choice of a database solution for third-party **Micro-Apps** developed for the ΛΞVON Armory is a critical strategic decision. It dictates the developer experience for our third-party Artisans, the security and isolation of our users' data, and the overall scalability of the ecosystem. We are not just choosing a technology; we are defining the foundation of our federated development model.

Based on analysis, there are two primary doctrinal paths: The Unified Citadel (Internal, Managed Tenancy) and The Federated Enclave (Backend-as-a-Service).

### 2. The Chosen Path: The Federated Enclave (Supabase)

The Unified Citadel path is a trap. It promises control but delivers complexity and risk that will stifle the growth of our ecosystem. The goal of the Armory is to attract the best Artisans, and the best Artisans demand the best tools and the lowest friction.

Therefore, the final decree is unequivocal: **We will proceed with Path 2, The Federated Enclave, using Supabase as the officially sanctioned data persistence layer for all third-party Micro-Apps.**

#### 2.1 How it Works
We will manage a central ΛΞVON OS organization within Supabase. Every approved Artisan in our developer program gets their own sandboxed "project" provisioned under our organization. Supabase provides a dedicated PostgreSQL database, auto-generating APIs, and, most critically, a simple yet powerful interface for managing Row-Level Security policies out of the box. Developers for the Armory will be given credentials to this Supabase project. Their Micro-App would communicate directly with the Supabase API using a user-specific JWT that we provide, ensuring all data access is automatically sandboxed to the correct user.

#### 2.2 Strategic Advantages
*   **Extreme Velocity:** Developers can get started instantly with a full backend, including a database, auth hooks, and storage. The developer experience is world-class.
*   **Managed Security & Isolation:** Supabase is purpose-built for multi-tenancy and RLS. It outsources the most complex and high-risk part of this problem to a specialized provider.
*   **Generous Free Tier:** Supabase offers a robust free tier with 500MB of database space and unlimited API requests, making it cost-effective to provide this to every developer in our ecosystem.
*   **Portability:** Since it's built on PostgreSQL, we retain the option to self-host or migrate away in the future if necessary.

### 3. Execution Plan

1.  We will establish a ΛΞVON OS organization within Supabase.
2.  The "Developer SDK & The Forge Guide" will be updated to include a section on "The Supabase Enclave," providing credentials and guides for our Artisans upon their acceptance into the program.
3.  Our `auth-service` will be configured to mint JWTs that are compatible with Supabase's RLS policies, ensuring every API call from a Micro-App is perfectly isolated to the correct user.

This decision prioritizes developer velocity and robust, managed security, allowing us to scale the Armory marketplace at maximum speed.
