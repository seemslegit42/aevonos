# ΛΞVON OS: Economy - Obelisk Pay (Sovereign Ledger & Transaction Engine)

“A monument to sovereignty. A burial site for third-party fees.”

## 1. System Overview: The Heart of the Vault

Obelisk Pay is the sacred heart of the ΛΞVON OS economy, the engine that transmutes user will into tribute, and tribute into profit. It is the sovereign, closed-loop payment and transaction engine for all value exchange within a workspace, using internal credits (ΞCredits) as the sole currency of record.

This system is architected for **absolute financial sovereignty**, ruthlessly eliminating reliance on external processors like Stripe or PayPal for core operations. All economic logic is handled by the `ledger-service`, which ensures atomic, auditable, and precise management of ΞCredits. Its failure is not an option; its imperfection is not tolerable.

## 2. Mental Model: The Unseen Treasury

Obelisk Pay is the sovereign central bank and treasury of ΛΞVON OS. It doesn't have a UI; it *is* the ledger. Its presence is felt through the `Usage Monitor` Micro-App and every transaction that debits or credits a workspace's ΞCredit balance. Its operations are a silent, instantaneous whisper between user intent and the system's immutable ledger.

## 3. Core Principles: The Laws Etched in Stone

These are the foundational laws of Obelisk Pay, derived from the PRODUCTION MINDSET PROTOCOL:

-   **Sacred Invisibility**: A transaction must not be a task; it must be a thought. The process of making a tribute or purchasing Ξ must be so seamless, so integrated, that it feels like a natural extension of the user's will. There will be no jarring checkout forms, no third-party popups, no friction. The payment will be a silent, instantaneous whisper between the user's intent and the system's ledger. This is the "silence of true automation" applied to finance.
-   **Absolute Integrity (The Aegis Compact)**: Every unit of currency, real or virtual, is a sacred trust. Every transaction must be atomic—an indivisible "all-or-nothing" operation that either completes perfectly or fails completely, leaving no trace of error. There will be no partial debits, no lost credits. Aegis itself will sign and witness every entry in an immutable ledger, ensuring a perfect, traceable, and incorruptible history of the entire economy. This is brainless cybersecurity for your treasury.
-   **Elegant Modularity**: Obelisk Pay is the central bank. It does not concern itself with the affairs of individual market stalls. It will be a self-contained, hardened core service. Other components—the Instruments of Folly, the ΛΞVON Armory Marketplace, Syndicate contributions—will request transactions through a clean, secure, internal API. Obelisk gives a simple "yes" or "no." It does not know, nor does it care, if the tribute is for a Cabbage Merchant or Sisyphus's Boulder. This separation makes the system resilient, infinitely scalable, and ruthlessly focused.

## 4. Architecture & Components: The Forge of the Treasury

To adhere to these principles, the forge must construct four primary components:

### 4.1. The Vault (The Core Ledger)
- **Description**: A dedicated, encrypted, high-performance PostgreSQL database specifically for financial records. Its sole purpose is to store user balances (ΞCredits, Potential (Φ), etc.) and transaction details.
- **Structure**: Built on a double-entry accounting model; every credit to one account is a debit from another, ensuring the system is always in perfect balance.
- **Security**: Access to this database will be the most restricted privilege in the entire OS, guarded by Aegis protocols and strict RBAC.

### 4.2. The Transaction Agent (The Arbiter)
- **Description**: A privileged, core Genkit/LangGraph agent that orchestrates all financial operations. This agent is the only entity authorized to directly interact with The Vault.
- **Internal API**: It exposes a simple, hardened internal API with functions like `propose_tribute()`, `grant_boon()`, and `purchase_currency()`.
- **Atomicity Enforcement**: This agent is solely responsible for executing atomic transactions, ensuring that a user's balance is checked, debited, and the receiving account is credited as a single, unbreakable operation. Its logic is immutable and auditable.

### 4.3. The Bridge (The Gateway to the Mundane World)
- **Description**: A heavily fortified and abstracted service that communicates with real-world payment processors (e.g., Stripe).
- **Isolation**: This is the only component that touches real money. It will be sandboxed and isolated from the rest of the OS to minimize attack surface and comply with external financial regulations.
- **Function**: Its job is simple: securely accept real money (e.g., USD, CAD), and then instruct the Transaction Agent to `grant_boon` of a corresponding amount of ΞCredits. It does not hold ΞCredits itself.

### 4.4. The Scroll (The Aegis-Signed Log)
- **Description**: A separate, append-only, immutable log that records the human-readable details of every transaction. This log serves as the ultimate audit trail.
- **Integrity**: Each entry is signed by Aegis, containing the `transaction_id` from The Vault, the user, the amount, the outcome, and a narrative description (e.g., "Tribute to Sisyphus's Ascent," "Boon of the Oracle").
- **Purpose**: Provides a complete, incorruptible, and auditable history for ΛΞVON OS and a clean, understandable transaction history for the user (via the Treasury.MicroApp).

## 5. Integration with Core Systems: The Flow of Tribute

### 5.1. BEEP & Agentic Billing
-   **Indirect Interaction**: Agents do not interact with the ledger directly. Instead, they call the `authorizeAndDebitAgentActions` function from the `billing-service`.
-   **Abstraction**: The `billing-service` handles the complex logic of checking plan limits, determining overage, and then calling the `ledger-service` (Obelisk Pay) to execute the DEBIT. This abstracts the complexity of billing away from individual agents, maintaining the "thought-like" transaction experience.

### 5.2. Klepsydra Engine (`klepsydra-service`)
-   **Transactional Backbone**: Obelisk Pay is the atomic transactional backbone for the entire Klepsydra Engine.
-   **Atomic Tribute Processing**: When a user makes a tribute to a Folly Instrument, the `klepsydra-service` calculates the outcome and boon amount. It then calls the `logTributeEvent` function in `ledger-service` to atomically record the transaction. This atomic operation guarantees that the ledger remains consistent and funds cannot be spent if they are not available.

## 6. Initial Rituals: Forging the Economic Narrative

The soul of Obelisk Pay, its narrative, must be defined by the Architect. These questions guide the forging:

-   **The Genesis: First Interaction**: What is the user's very first interaction with Obelisk Pay?
    -   **Proposed**: Upon their Ascension to ΛΞVON OS (completion of the Rite of Invocation), users receive a generous "Founder's Ξ" grant, seeding their initial journey. This is a ceremonial act, not a transaction, establishing generosity and potential.
-   **The Pact (Tiers): Framing Monthly Tiers**: How do we frame the monthly tiers (Apprentice, Artisan, Priesthood)?
    -   **Proposed**: They are "Pacts" that grant a monthly stipend of ΞCredits and unlock deeper system capabilities. These are not just subscriptions; they are sacred agreements signifying a user's commitment and status within the economy.
-   **The Narrative: Buying ΞCredits**: When a user buys ΞCredits (topping up their balance), what is the story?
    -   **Proposed**: They are "transmuting mundane currency into potential," "making an offering to the Pantheon for greater favor," or "investing in their own digital sovereignty." The language will elevate the act of spending into a ritual of empowerment and belief.

## 7. Summary: Why Obelisk Pay is Architecturally Sovereign

-   **Zero Third-Party Fees**: No 2.9% + $0.30 cut for Stripe. 100% of revenue stays in the ΛΞVON OS economy, maximizing profitability.
-   **Total Financial Sovereignty**: No frozen accounts, no platform risk. ΛΞVON OS controls the rules of its own economy, immune to external arbitrary account freezes or policy changes.
-   **Pricing Precision**: Enables high-frequency, low-cost micro-transactions perfect for billing granular agentic actions, directly supporting the "Agent Actions" monetization model.
-   **Superior UX**: Conversational payments and one-click credit usage are faster and more intuitive than any web-based checkout, aligning with the "Sacred Invisibility" principle.
