# ΛΞVON OS: Interoperability Engine (iPaaS Layer)

## 1. Purpose & Vision

The Interoperability Engine is a core subsystem designed to facilitate seamless connectivity and data exchange between ΛΞVON OS and external enterprise systems, APIs, and data sources. It transforms the OS from a self-contained environment into a true central nexus for an organization's digital operations.

## 2. Key Capabilities

*   **Built-in iPaaS Layer**: Provides pre-built connectors for common systems (ERPs, CRMs, payment APIs, communication platforms, productivity suites), abstracting away the complexity of authentication and data mapping. This has been implemented via the `Integration Nexus` Micro-App and its backend APIs.
*   **Custom Connector SDK**: A future development path will provide a Software Development Kit for developers to build and submit their own connectors to The Armory.
*   **API Management**: Enables the definition, publishing, versioning, and securing of custom APIs that expose core ΛΞVON OS functionalities to the outside world, managed via the `api-spec.md`.

## 3. Implementation: The Integration Nexus

The primary user-facing component of this engine is the **`Integration Nexus` Micro-App**.

*   **Function**: Allows users to view, configure, and manage their active integrations with third-party services.
*   **Configuration**: Users can select from a list of available integration manifests and provide the necessary credentials (API keys, OAuth grants) to activate a connection.
*   **Status Monitoring**: The Nexus provides at-a-glance status information for each active integration, indicating whether the connection is healthy or requires attention.
