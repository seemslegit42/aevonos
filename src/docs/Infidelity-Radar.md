# Infidelity Radar: The Spectre Intelligence Suite - Technical Specification

> "Because intuition deserves evidence."

---

## 1. System Overview

The Infidelity Radar is not a single tool but a **specialized intelligence suite** implemented as a Micro-App. It provides a collection of agentic capabilities designed for digital investigation and behavioral analysis in the context of relationship security.

It is a discreet, powerful, and ethically ambiguous toolkit for transforming suspicion into structured, actionable intelligence.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

The suite is composed of several independent but interoperable agents, all orchestrated through a single UI.

### 2.1. `osint-agent` (`agents/osint.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Acts as a digital bloodhound, scouring open sources for information.
- **Architecture**: As a specialist daemon in the Groq Swarm, this agent is implemented using `LangGraph` for multi-step reasoning. It first plans which intelligence tools to use, executes them with blistering speed thanks to Groq's inference engine, and then synthesizes the results into a final report.
- **Flow**: The `performOsintScan` flow orchestrates a suite of dedicated tools (`checkEmailBreaches`, `searchIntelX`, `runFirecrawlerScan`) to gather data on a target.
- **Synthesis**: The raw data from all tool calls is synthesized by an LLM into a coherent `OsintOutputSchema`, providing a summary, risk factors, and structured data on breaches, leaks, and social profiles.

### 2.2. `infidelity-analysis-agent` (`agents/infidelity-analysis.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Provides a clinical, behavioral analysis of a situation.
- **Flow**: The `performInfidelityAnalysis` flow takes a user's description of a situation and uses a Groq-powered LLM, prompted as a private investigator, to calculate a `riskScore`, write a `riskSummary`, and identify the `keyFactors` that contributed to the score with extreme speed.

### 2.3. `decoy-agent` (`agents/decoy.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Deploys a social engineering probe to test a target's loyalty.
- **Flow**: The `deployDecoy` flow crafts a compelling, persona-driven opening message designed to elicit a response from a target, based on a brief description. This analysis and generation is supercharged by the Groq LPU engine.

### 2.4. `dossier-agent` (`agents/dossier-agent.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Compiles all gathered intelligence into a formal report.
- **Flow**: The `generateDossier` flow takes the outputs from the other agents and uses a Groq-powered LLM to format them into a professional Markdown document, available in a standard or "legal" format, in near real-time.

### 2.5. The "Burn Bridge Protocol" (`agents/burn-bridge-agent.ts`)
- **Function**: A master `LangGraph` agent that orchestrates the entire suite. When a user issues the "burn the bridge" command, BEEP delegates to this agent. The Burn Bridge agent then calls the OSINT, analysis, and decoy agents in parallel, then feeds their outputs into the dossier agent to generate the final, comprehensive report.

### 2.6. The `InfidelityRadar` Micro-App (`micro-apps/infidelity-radar.tsx`)
- **Orchestration UI**: A single, tab-based interface that provides manual access to each agentic function (OSINT scan, behavioral analysis, decoy deployment, dossier export), allowing the user to run them individually or trigger the full "Burn Bridge Protocol".

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Invocation**: The suite can be launched from the Canvas or via BEEP commands.
- **Agentic Control**: All functions are exposed as tools to BEEP, allowing for complex, chained commands (e.g., the Burn Bridge Protocol).
- **Billing**: Each agent call (OSINT scan, analysis, etc.) is a distinct, high-value, billable action, debited by Obelisk Pay.
- **The Armory**: As a powerful and specialized suite, the Infidelity Radar is listed in The Armory as a premium, high-cost, one-time purchase.
