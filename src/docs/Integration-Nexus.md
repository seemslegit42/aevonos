# Integration Nexus: The Conductor of Worlds - Technical Specification

> "The OS does not exist in a vacuum. It is the heart of a larger body. Here are its veins."

---

## 1. System Overview

The Integration Nexus is a **core utility Micro-App** that serves as the command center for the OS's Interoperability Engine. It provides a centralized interface for users with sufficient privileges (`ADMIN`) to connect, configure, and manage data flows between ΛΞVON OS and external third-party services.

This is not simply a list of plugins; it is the switchboard through which the OS extends its agentic will into other platforms like Slack, Google Workspace, and Stripe.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `IntegrationNexus` Micro-App (`micro-apps/integration-nexus.tsx`)
The UI is a clean, secure interface for managing connections.
- **Connection Management**: Displays a list of currently configured integrations, showing their status (active, inactive, error).
- **Add Integration Flow**: A dialog-based workflow that allows an administrator to select a service from a pre-defined manifest, provide a name for the instance, and enter the necessary credentials (e.g., API key).
- **Configuration & Deletion**: Provides a secure way to edit the configuration or delete an existing integration, which revokes the OS's access to that service.

### 2.2. Configuration-as-Code (`config/integration-manifests.ts`)
- **Manifests**: The catalog of available integrations is driven by a static manifest file. This ensures that all potential connections are version-controlled and well-defined, specifying the name, description, icon, and required authentication method (`api_key`, `oauth2`) for each service.

### 2.3. Backend APIs (`api/integrations/`)
- **`GET /api/integrations`**: Retrieves a list of all integrations that have been configured for the current workspace.
- **`POST /api/integrations`**: Creates a new integration instance, securely storing the provided credentials and configuration details, scoped to the workspace.
- **`DELETE /api/integrations/{id}`**: Deletes an integration instance and purges its credentials.

### 2.4. Agentic Tooling
- The true power of the Integration Nexus is realized through the agentic tools it enables. For example, once a Slack integration is configured, a `sendSlackMessage` tool becomes available to the BEEP agent. The existence and functionality of these tools are directly tied to the active integrations configured in the Nexus.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Invocation**: The Integration Nexus can be launched from the Canvas or The Armory.
- **Permissions**: Access to configure integrations is strictly limited to `ADMIN` users to prevent unauthorized connections to external services.
- **Architectural Role**: It serves as the primary gateway for data and commands flowing into and out of the OS, transforming it from a standalone platform into a true central nervous system for a business's entire digital stack. It is the physical manifestation of the Interoperability Engine.
