# ΛΞVON OS: Security Operations & Incident Response Plan
Document Version: 1.0
Codename: The Aegis Protocol
Status: Canonized
Author: ARCHIVEX
1. The Sentinel's Vow: An Introduction
This document is the operational codification of our promise: ΛΞVON OS is the "MOST SECURE" platform. It is the practical playbook for our security fabric, Aegis, and the human Incident Response Team (IRT) that acts as its final arbiter.
Our security posture is not passive; it is an active, unending hunt. Aegis is the vigilant eye, but this protocol is the sword arm. It defines how we classify threats, how we respond with surgical precision, and how we learn from every engagement to harden our defenses. When a threat manifests, we do not panic; we execute the Aegis Protocol.
2. The Incident Response Team (IRT)
The IRT is a designated group of individuals responsible for executing this plan.
Architect (IRT Lead): The ultimate decision-making authority. Authorizes critical actions, including public notifications and major system changes.
Lead Engineer (Technical Lead): Leads the technical investigation and remediation efforts. Directs the engineering team during an incident.
Security Analyst (Aegis Handler): The first responder. Monitors Aegis alerts, performs initial triage, and executes predefined containment playbooks.
Data Protection Officer (DPO): Advises on legal and regulatory obligations, particularly concerning data breaches under PIPEDA, as defined in the Data Governance Protocol.
3. Incident Classification Matrix
Threats are classified by severity to ensure a proportional and timely response.
SEV Level
Name
Description & Examples
IRT Response Time
SEV-1
Critical Threat
Active system breach, significant data loss (especially Class IV Sacred data), compromise of economic integrity.
Immediate (5 mins)




Active root compromise of a production server; SQL injection leading to PII exfiltration; bug allowing infinite ΞCredit generation.


SEV-2
High Threat
Potential for data breach, service degradation affecting all users, compromised user accounts with high privileges.
High (30 mins)




Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability on a core page; successful brute-force of an Architect account; DoS attack causing significant latency.


SEV-3
Moderate Threat
Localized service outages, minor bugs with security implications, non-critical policy violations.
Medium (4 hours)




A single Micro-App is unresponsive; a user discovers a method to bypass a Folly Instrument's cooldown timer.


SEV-4
Low Threat
Pre-production vulnerabilities, low-impact bugs, suspicious activity flagged by Aegis for review.
Low (24 hours)




A dependency with a known low-severity vulnerability is detected; Aegis flags a user logging in from an unusual but plausible location.



4. The Aegis Cycle: Incident Response Lifecycle
Every incident follows a structured, six-phase response cycle.
Detection & Alerting:
Automated: Aegis continuously monitors system logs and telemetry. Upon detecting an anomaly that matches a rule or ML model, it automatically creates an incident ticket in the designated system (e.g., PagerDuty, Opsgenie) and alerts the on-call Aegis Handler.
Manual: An incident can be manually declared by any team member who discovers a potential threat.
Containment (The Shield Wall):
The first priority is to stop the bleeding. The Aegis Handler's immediate responsibility is to contain the threat and prevent further damage.
Automated Actions: Aegis may automatically quarantine a service, block a source IP address, or revoke compromised credentials.
Manual Actions: The Aegis Handler will execute a pre-defined playbook corresponding to the alert type. This may involve disabling a feature flag, reverting a recent deployment, or manually locking a user account.
Investigation & Analysis:
The IRT collaborates to understand the root cause. This involves deep analysis of Aegis logs, application logs, and system metrics.
The goal is to answer: What happened? How did it happen? What is the scope of the impact?
Eradication & Remediation:
Once the root cause is identified, the Technical Lead directs the effort to eliminate the threat and fix the underlying vulnerability. This could involve deploying a hotfix, patching a server, or correcting a misconfiguration.
Recovery:
The IRT verifies that the threat has been eradicated and the system is stable.
Services are carefully brought back online. This may involve restoring data from backups (as per the RPO/RTO defined in the SRS) and intensive monitoring to ensure the threat does not recur.
Post-Mortem & Refinement (The Lesson Forged):
For all SEV-1 and SEV-2 incidents, a blameless post-mortem is mandatory.
The IRT documents the incident timeline, root cause, impact, and actions taken.
The most critical output is a list of actionable follow-up tasks to improve defenses, tooling, or processes to prevent the incident from happening again.
5. Communication Protocol
Internal: A dedicated, secure channel (e.g., a private Slack channel) is used for all incident-related communication. The Aegis Handler provides regular status updates to the IRT and key stakeholders.
User Notification (The Sentinel's Voice):
For incidents affecting user experience (e.g., downtime), BEEP's Sentinel persona will be activated to provide clear, concise status updates within the OS.
For security incidents requiring user action (e.g., a recommended password reset), users will be notified directly via email and an in-OS alert.
Regulatory Notification: In the event of a data breach meeting the criteria defined in the Data Governance Protocol, the DPO will manage all communications with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and affected individuals.
6. Core Security Playbooks
The following are high-level playbooks for common scenarios.
Playbook 1: Compromised User Account (SEV-2)
Detection: Aegis detects impossible travel or credential stuffing.
Containment: Aegis automatically locks the account and terminates all active sessions.
Investigation: Aegis Handler reviews access logs to determine the scope of unauthorized activity.
Remediation: IRT forces a password reset and notifies the user via their registered email with instructions.
Playbook 2: Data Exfiltration Attempt (SEV-1)
Detection: Aegis's ML model detects a user or service attempting to download an anomalously large volume of data.
Containment: Aegis automatically revokes the credentials of the offending user/service and blocks the outbound network connection. The IRT is immediately paged.
Investigation: The IRT performs a deep forensic analysis to determine what data, if any, was successfully exfiltrated.
Remediation: The vulnerability that allowed the attempt is patched. The DPO is engaged to determine if regulatory notification is required.
This plan ensures that our response to threats is as sophisticated and disciplined as the system we are protecting. It is a living document, to be refined and hardened after every trial by fire.
