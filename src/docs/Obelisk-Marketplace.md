# The Obelisk Marketplace & The Ledger of the Fates

> "A user cannot turn their Ξ into cash. But they can turn it into permanent sovereignty."

---

## 1. System Overview

The Obelisk Marketplace is the apex of the ΛΞVON OS economy, an exclusive sanctum where accumulated ΞCredits are transmuted into real-world assets of power. It is distinct from The Armory, which is for acquiring day-to-day tools.

## 2. The Marketplace Micro-App (`micro-apps/obelisk-marketplace.tsx`)

The primary interface to the Marketplace is a **privileged Micro-App**, accessible only to users who have achieved a high Sovereignty Class (proxied by the `OWNER` role in the current implementation).

-   **Invocation**: Summoned via BEEP command ("BEEP, reveal the Obelisk Marketplace.") or launched from the Armory.
-   **UI**: A high-end, curated view of available real-world assets and services.
-   **Offerings**: The Marketplace displays a static, curated list of high-value items, such as perpetual software licenses, custom hardware, or exclusive consulting services.
-   **Tribute Proposal**: Each item has a "Propose Tribute" button. Clicking this does not complete a transaction but sends a notification to a `Proxy.Agent` (a future manual or automated system) for review and fulfillment, creating a high-touch, premium experience.

## 3. The Ledger of the Fates: The Measure of Dominance

The Ledger of the Fates is not yet implemented but is planned as a core component of the Marketplace.

-   **Ranking**: It will rank users by "Risk-Adjusted Dominance," weighing tributes against winnings.
-   **Status**: Top players are anointed the "Favored of Tyche," granting them a tangible economic advantage (e.g., discounts on Chaos Cards).

## 4. Economic Doctrine: Why This is Superior to Cash

-   **Maintains the Loop**: Reinvests value back into the user's sovereignty and the OS ecosystem.
-   **Avoids Regulatory Hell**: We sell curated goods and services, not financial instruments.
-   **Vastly More Profitable**: We acquire goods and services at a business cost and offer them for a ΞCredit value that we control entirely.
-   **Ultimate Retention Mechanism**: Provides powerful, tangible reasons to stay, to become more integrated, and to reach for the next tier of power.
