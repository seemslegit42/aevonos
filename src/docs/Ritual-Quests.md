# Ritual Quests: The Path to Alignment - Technical Specification

> "A vow unacted is a vow broken."

---

## 1. System Overview

Ritual Quests are a **proactive engagement mechanic** designed to guide users along their chosen path and increase their Vow Alignment Score (VAS). They are delivered via a dedicated **`Ritual Quests` Micro-App** and serve as personalized, context-aware challenges generated by a specialist AI agent.

This system is a direct implementation of Phase III of the Doctrine of Sovereign Systems, transforming the user journey from passive tool usage into an active, guided ritual of self-improvement and Covenant alignment.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `ritual-quests-agent` (`agents/ritual-quests-agent.ts`)
The agent's logic resides in the `generateRitualQuests` flow.
-   **Psyche-Driven Generation**: The agent's core prompt is dynamically constructed based on the user's `psyche`. It generates a list of 3-4 quests specifically tailored to the philosophy of the user's Covenant (Motion, Worship, or Silence).
-   **Input**: Accepts the user's `psyche` enum.
-   **Output (`RitualQuestsOutputSchema`)**: Returns a structured list of `Quest` objects, each containing a `title`, `description`, a mock `reward` in ΞCredits, and the BEEP `command` to initiate the quest.

### 2.2. The `RitualQuests` Micro-App (`micro-apps/ritual-quests.tsx`)
The UI is a simple, elegant quest log that displays the user's current quests.
-   **Quest Log**: On launch, the app invokes the `getRitualQuests` tool via BEEP. The returned quests are then displayed as a list of `QuestCard` components.
-   **Quest Card**: Each card clearly presents the quest's title, description, and reward. It includes a "Begin Quest" button that, when clicked, copies the associated BEEP command to the clipboard and provides a toast notification guiding the user to paste it into the command bar. This reinforces the "Command-First" prime directive.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

-   **Invocation**: The Ritual Quests app can be launched from The Armory or summoned via a BEEP command like, "Show me my sacred quests."
-   **Agentic Control**: BEEP uses the `getRitualQuests` tool to fetch quests tailored to the current user's psyche.
-   **Vow Alignment Score (VAS)**: Completing Ritual Quests is a primary driver for increasing a user's VAS. Future implementations will have the agent verify quest completion and update the score in the user's `PulseProfile`.
-   **Architectural Role**: Ritual Quests serve as a key retention and engagement loop, turning passive users into active participants in their own journey of mastery and reinforcing the unique cultural identity of each Covenant.
