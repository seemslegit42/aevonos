# Uncut Truth Engine (Validator): File Integrity Verification - Technical Specification

> "The hash doesn't lie."

---

## 1. System Overview

The Uncut Truth Engine, or "Validator," is a **core security utility Micro-App**. It provides a simple, secure, and client-side interface for verifying the integrity of a file by comparing its SHA256 hash against a known value.

It is designed to be a trustworthy tool for confirming that a file, such as an exported dossier, has not been altered or corrupted.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `Validator` Micro-App (`micro-apps/validator.tsx`)
The UI is a straightforward, two-part interface for file and hash input.
- **File Input**: A drag-and-drop area allows the user to select a local file. The app uses the `FileReader` API to read the file's contents into an `ArrayBuffer` directly in the browser. This process is entirely client-side; the file is **never** uploaded to a server.
- **Hash Input**: A text `Input` for the user to paste the expected SHA256 hash of the file.
- **Verification Logic**:
  1.  When the user clicks "Verify," the `crypto-js` library is used to calculate the SHA256 hash of the file's `ArrayBuffer`.
  2.  This calculated hash is then compared against the user-provided hash.
  3.  The result (`success` or `error`) is displayed to the user in a color-coded `Alert` component.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Invocation**: The Validator can be launched from the Canvas or The Armory. It is often used in conjunction with the `DossierExportPanel`, which provides a "copy hash" button for the exported file.
- **Security Principle**: By performing all hashing client-side, the Validator upholds a key security principle: the platform never needs to see or handle the user's sensitive, exported data to verify its integrity. This reinforces user trust and data privacy.
- **Architectural Role**: The Validator is a fundamental trust-building tool. It provides a tangible way for users to confirm that the artifacts generated by the OS are authentic and untampered, which is especially critical for sensitive outputs like legal dossiers or financial reports.
