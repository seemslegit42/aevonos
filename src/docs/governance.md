# ΛΞVON OS: Governance - Security Practices

## 1. Core Philosophy: Security-by-Design

Security in ΛΞVON OS is a foundational, pervasive layer woven into the very fabric of the operating system. It is designed to make ΛΞVON OS the "MOST SECURE" platform by ensuring that security is inherent and autonomous, reducing the burden on SMBs.

## 2. Architectural Principles & Implementation

### 2.1. Zero-Trust Architecture

-   **Principle**: No user, device, or system is inherently trusted. All access requests are continuously verified.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   **Authentication**: All API routes and protected pages are secured by `middleware.ts`, which validates a JWT `session` cookie. Unauthenticated access is rejected or redirected.
    -   **Authorization**: API routes check the `UserRole` (e.g., `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `OPERATOR`, `AUDITOR`) from the validated session to authorize sensitive actions like creating workflows or deleting agents.

### 2.2. Data Protection & Isolation

-   **Multi-Tenancy**: Strict data isolation is enforced at the database level. The `workspaceId` from the user's JWT session is used in every Prisma query to ensure users can only access data belonging to their workspace.
-   **Encryption**: All sensitive data, such as passwords, are hashed using `bcryptjs`. The JWT session token itself is encrypted using the `jose` library with a strong secret key.
-   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: By design, agents and tools are scoped to the authenticated workspace, preventing accidental cross-pollination of data.

### 2.3. Secure Credential Management

-   **Principle**: Never hardcode secrets.
-   **Implementation**: LLM API keys, database connection strings, and the JWT secret are stored securely as environment variables (e.g., in a `.env` file for local development or as secrets in the deployment environment like Vercel). The application code is designed to fail gracefully or use mock data if these keys are not present.

## 3. Aegis in Action: Proactive Monitoring & Response

Aegis is the vigilant, AI-powered bodyguard, watching everything and protecting with zero manual input.

-   **Agentic Anomaly Detection**: The `aegisAnomalyScan` flow is a core agentic tool. It is called by other critical services (like `billing-tools` during a credit top-up) and by BEEP's central command loop to analyze user commands for suspicious patterns *before* execution.
-   **Human-Readable Alerts**: When Aegis detects an anomaly, it generates a report with a clear, plain-English explanation, a risk level (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`), and a suggested course of action.
-   **Automated Alert Creation**: High-risk anomalies detected by Aegis automatically trigger the `createSecurityAlertInDb` tool, creating a persistent record in the database that is visible in the `Aegis-ThreatScope` Micro-App.

## 4. Development Directives: Building Securely

All developers are "forge priests of automation" and MUST adhere to these directives:

-   **Build Like He's Watching**: Every new agent, tool, or API endpoint must be developed with Aegis's constant vigilance in mind. If a feature involves sensitive data or execution of powerful actions, it should consider invoking `aegisAnomalyScan`.
-   **Enforce RBAC**: When creating new API routes for sensitive operations, always check the user's role from the session and enforce the principle of least privilege.
-   **Validate All Inputs**: Use `Zod` to strictly validate all incoming data for API requests and agent inputs. Never trust user-provided data.
-   **Scope Database Queries**: Every Prisma query that accesses workspace-specific data MUST include a `where` clause with the `workspaceId` from the session.
-   **Immutable Audit Logging**: The `Transaction` table serves as an immutable financial ledger, recording every credit and debit to a workspace's balance, including agent actions.
-   **Agent Sandboxing**: Tools available to the BEEP agent are explicitly defined and scoped. The agent cannot call arbitrary functions or access the filesystem outside of its defined capabilities.
